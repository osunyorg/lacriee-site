biography: >-
  <p>Christelle Familiari, born in Niort in 1972, is a contemporary plasticist. </p><p>As early as 1995, Christelle Familiari became known through videos and performances that ignored the social carcans surrounding the issue of desire, sex and boredom. This practice of self-filming and performance which involves him physically has gradually led to the search for plastic means that would allow him to evoke the body: his, his gesture of artist in a cunning, strange, indiscernable, diffuse physical presence; and that of the visitor, in his intimate relationship with the work but also with the exhibition space.<br><br>The making of various wool objects made by crochet (slip to masturbation, slip to penetration, hood for lovers, arm to dance the slow...) illustrates this slip which leads to the realization of anthropomorphic sculptures (the Portico and the Seat for two places) whose peculiarity is to offer "negotiating spaces" to the people who use them. This interest in the physical relationship that the visitor has with the work encourages him to develop a sculptural practice capable of combining performance and effort, flexibility and rigidity, the scale of his body... to the surfaces of the exhibition venues, whose carpet "Extensive [archive]" (400 square meters of interlaced wire), presented at the Frac des Pays de la Loire in 2003, will be the first manifestation.<br><br>This work, which has been growing for fifteen years, gradually affirms all the interest it brings to impermanence and its distrust of any formalist attempt. </p>
