    <p>  <br>Born 1973 in Clermont-Ferrand, France Lives and works in Paris, France</p>  <p>   <br>Questioning the relationship between production, local knowledge and contemporary creation, the thematic cycle  Lili, rozell and marimba  (creation <br>(c) is accompanied by a review. This <br>to extend and broaden the questions raised by <br>guest artists in exhibitions and residences <br>the cycle. To develop its content, an editorial committee <br>composed of Lotte Arndt, Jean-Roch Bouiller, Baptiste Brun, John Cornu, <br>Katia Kameli, Sophie Kaplan and Émilie Renard meet regularly <br>Throughout the cycle. Whether they are artists, researchers or <br>members share a common purpose <br>and other, at the same time as they are <br>differentiating by fields of research and sometimes viewpoints <br>far away. The practice of Katia Kameli, artist and director <br>Franco-Algérien, based on a research approach: <br>historical and cultural nourishes the plural forms of his imagination <br>Plastic and poetic. She considers herself a "translator." The <br>translation is not a simple passage between two cultures or a simple <br>act of transmission, but also works as an extension of meaning and forms. The act of <br>translation deconstructs the binary and sometimes hierarchical relationship between <br>the concept of original and copy. A rewriting of the narratives appears in <br>in his work. It highlights a story, global, made <br>of porous boundaries and reciprocal influences in order to open up a <br>reflexive and generating a critical look at the world. Katia Kameli graduated from the National School of Fine Arts of <br>Bourges and followed the post-diploma College-Invisible at school <br>higher art of Marseille. His work found visibility and recognition on the <br>international art and cinema scene and has been shown <br>at personal exhibitions:  She Rekindled the Vividness of the Pastla,  Kunsthalle Münster, 2019;  In the shadow of the star and the crescent , regional photography centre Hauts-de-France, Douchy-les-Mines, 2018;  Stream of Stories, Chapter 5 , Rennes Workshops, Biennial of Contemporary Art, 2016 ;  What Language Do You Speak Stranger? , The Mosaic Rooms, London, 2016 Taymour Grahne Gallery, New York, 2014. She has also participated in numerous collective exhibitions: <br>Dakar Biennial, 2018; Rennes Workshops, 2018; Platforma <br>Festival, Newcastle, 2017;  Global Players , biennial für aktuelle fotografie Kunstverein Ludwigshafen, Mannheim, 2017 ;  Dear Friends , Centre Pompidou, Paris, 2016 ;  Made in Algeria , Mucem, Marseille, 2016 ;  Entry Prohibited to Foreigners , Havre Magistreet, Boden, Sweden, 2015 ;  Higher Atlas , Marrakesh Biennial, 2012. His films have also been shown in theatre and in many <br>festivals : MK2 Beaubourg, French Cinematheque, Utopia Bordeaux, <br>Cinemed, Gulbenkian, IFRR Rotterdam.
