To develop its content, an editorial committee <br>composed of Lotte Arndt, Jean-Roch Bouiller, Baptiste Brun, John Cornu, <br>Katia Kameli, Sophie Kaplan and Émilie Renard meet regularly <br>Throughout the cycle. Whether they are artists, researchers or <br>members share a common purpose <br>and other, at the same time as they are <br>differentiating by fields of research and sometimes viewpoints <br>far away. The practice of Katia Kameli, artist and director <br>Franco-Algérien, based on a research approach: <br>historical and cultural nourishes the plural forms of his imagination <br>Plastic and poetic.

The act of <br>translation deconstructs the binary and sometimes hierarchical relationship between <br>the concept of original and copy. A rewriting of the narratives appears in <br>in his work. It highlights a story, global, made <br>of porous boundaries and reciprocal influences in order to open up a <br>reflexive and generating a critical look at the world.
