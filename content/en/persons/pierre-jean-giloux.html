biography: >-
  <p>Pierre Jean Giloux's work is the result of associations and hybridizations, at the crossroads of several practices. Using digital, video, 2D and 3D techniques, he develops a work of collage and editing. Graphic interventions on his images enable him to create “reconstructed worlds” that alter our perceptions of reality. The challenge is to make the virtual and the real cohabit within a space-in-between, and to establish a dialogue to question them. <br>Interested in urban forms and their evolution, his prospective fictions take as their starting point filmed and photographed urban and social realities. <br>They are extended by computer-generated images, which situates his artistic practice close to what is commonly known as augmented reality.<br>Pierre Jean Giloux is supported by Solang production.<br></p>
