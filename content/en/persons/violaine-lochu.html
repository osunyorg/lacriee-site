biography: >-
  <p>Born in 1987, Violaine Lochu lives and works between Montreuil in France and Cotonou in Benin. She is a graduate of the École nationale supérieure d'art de Paris Cergy and holds a Master II in visual arts research (Université Rennes 2).<br>Violaine Lochu's work explores the voice as a vehicle for encounters and metamorphosis. During long periods of immersion in specific environments, she collects various sound and visual materials from which she creates performances, sound installations, videos and publications. <br>Her practice is transdisciplinary, evolving in the fields of visual arts, experimental music and sound poetry, creating bridges between contemporary and ancient worlds, scholarly and vernacular, drawing inspiration from encounters with human and non-human entities, as well as from readings in the humanities. Encounters and collaboration (with other musicians, choreographers, visual artists, researchers in the humanities, etc.) are at the heart of her approach.</p>
