    <p>  <br>Born in 1981 in Lebanon Lives and works between Beirut and Paris.</p>  <p>   <br>Born in Lebanon in the midst of the civil war (1978-1990),  <br>Charbel-joseph H. Boutros' work does not seek to reflect reality, but  <br>rather to resist it, by capturing the immaterial. His works are based on <br> personal experience, geography (particularly his many travels), art  <br>history and political and historical questioning. The artist approaches  <br>invisibility as a material in its own right, mixing concrete, wax and  <br>marble with wishes, love and sunlight. He is a representative of the young Lebanese art scene, whose work is presented internationally. He has been a resident at the Jan van Eyck Academie, Netherlands, and at the Pavillon du Palais de Tokyo, where he has exhibited (during a module in 2014; and Sueur d'étoile, intervention on the roof of the building in 2015).  Charbel-joseph H. Boutros has presented his work at the Palais de  <br>Tokyo, the Istanbul International Biennial (Turkey), the Centre Pompidou <br> - Metz, S.M.A.K.
