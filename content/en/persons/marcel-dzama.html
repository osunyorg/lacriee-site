biography: >-
  <p>Marcel Dzama was born in 1974 in Winnipeg, Canada, where he received his BFA in 1997 from the University of Manitoba. He lives and works in Brooklyn, New York.<br>Since rising to prominence in the late 1990s, Marcel Dzama has developed an immediately recognizable visual language that investigates human action and motivation, as well as the blurred relationship between the real and the subconscious. Drawing equally from folk vernacular as from art-historical and contemporary influences, Dzama’s work visualizes a universe of childhood fantasies and otherworldly fairy tales. <br>his work has been represented by <a href="https://www.davidzwirner.com/artists/marcel-dzama" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">David Zwirner <span class="sr-only">(external link)</span></a> (New York, Los Angeles, London, Paris and Hong Kong), <a href="https://www.sieshoeke.com/artists/marcel-dzama" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Sies+Höke <span class="sr-only">(external link)</span></a> (Düsseldorf) and <a href="https://www.timvanlaeregallery.com/marcel-dzama" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Tim Van Laere  <span class="sr-only">(external link)</span></a>(Anvers).</p>
