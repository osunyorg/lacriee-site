    <p>  <br>1 box and 7 scupted wooden pieces</p>  <p>   <br>Les gestes vernaculaires: le travail à la godille  is a sculptural  <br>ensemble created by Julien Laforge and eleven second-year CAP Menuisier  <br>Fabricant students from September 2021 to May 2022, as part of a  <br>residency at the Alphonse Pellé vocational high school in  <br>Dol-de-Bretagne. Julien Laforge and the students studied the geographical and  <br>hydrographic situation of the marshes of Dol-de-Bretagne. They drew  <br>inspiration from it to create numerous forms in various woods (red oak,  <br>linden, poplar). Throughout the project, they tried to move away from standardized  <br>manufacturing formats and gestures to reconnect with vernacular gestures <br> and 'hand' woodworking. The students, alone or in small groups, created <br> about a dozen sculptures that fit together, inspired by the movements  <br>of water and the shapes of hydraulic structures. The artist then  <br>assembled them like links in a chain. The ensemble is housed in a  <br>'landscape chest' covered with bas-reliefs featuring fragments and  <br>motifs of marsh landscapes, inspired by Breton furniture. The artworks were exhibited at the Dol-de-Bretagne media library and the high school's CDI in May 2022." supports : -- Ministry of Culture -- Drac Bretagne -- Région Bretagne -- KARTA -- Académie de Rennes -- ADAGE</p>  <p> Connections  <br>  </p>  <p>Julien Laforge et les élèves CAP 2 Menuisier Fabricant,  Les gestes vernaculaires à la godille , médiathèque Dol-de-Bretagne, 2022</p>
