        <p><i>Cercle de Cues #5</i> is like an orange sun beyond the clouds and storms. The work is part of a  series inspired by the works of Nicholas of Cusa, a theologian,  philosopher, mathematician, and humanist of the 15th century. In De  Docta Ignorantia (1440), he attempts to solve the quadrature of the  circle, an unsolvable geometric problem that reveals the impossibility  of perfection with mathematical measuring tools, the ruler and compass.  Evariste Richer perceives its resolution in uncertainty, the  indefinable, and the distortion of vision. He translates it here into a  colored polygon drawn on enameled metal plates. The whole produces an  optical illusion, like a vibration of color in space.</p>
