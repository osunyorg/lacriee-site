    LiZellBa - jeu de plateau

    <p>Léa Bénétou, Yann Baïzid, Fanny Martel</p>
  body: >-
    <p>  <br>LiZellBa  is the result of a collaboration between La Criée and three  <br>artists: Léa Bennetou, Fanny Martel, and Yan Baïzid, who imagined,  <br>conceptualized, developed, and created it. The game invites participants <br> to create a fictional exhibition. It allows them to discover and engage <br> with the themes and works from various exhibitions that took place at  <br>the art center during the cycle  Lili, la rozell et le marimb a  <br>(contemporary and vernacular creation). The game is played on the floor and involves rolling a face-dice using a  <br>hat-pot on a colorful fabric board, then answering questions about the  <br>exhibitions using text, icon, or action cards. A correct answer allows  <br>players to draw an artwork miniature, a replica of a work exhibited at  <br>La Criée, and place it in an exhibition space. The process is repeated  <br>until the players are satisfied with their exhibition. A game of LiZellBa allows players to develop their knowledge of contemporary art. The game enables players to: -- Discover artworks and exhibitions  <br>-- Explore artists' sources of inspiration <br> -- View the current exhibition from a different perspective <br> -- Handle miniature artworks with various textures, materials, and colors, inspired by the works presented at La Criée and their manufacturing techniques. <br> -- Learn about the role of an exhibition curator and create their own exhibition.</p>  <p>  </p>  <p>LiZellBa , Léa Bénétou, Fanny Martel, Yann Baïzid, game around the art cycle  Lili, la rozell et le marimba , 2020  Photo : Marion Sarrazin <br>            </p>  <p>  <br>            </p>  <p>LiZellBa , Léa Bénétou, Fanny Martel, Yann Baïzid, game around the art cycle  Lili, la rozell et le marimba , 2020  Photo : Marion Sarrazin <br>            </p>  <p>LiZellBa , Léa Bénétou, Fanny Martel, Yann Baïzid, game around the art cycle  Lili, la rozell et le marimba , 2020  Photo : Marion Sarrazin <br>            </p>  <p>LiZellBa , Léa Bénétou, Fanny Martel, Yann Baïzid, game around the art cycle  Lili, la rozell et le marimba , 2020  Photo : Marion Sarrazin <br>            </p>  <p> Connections  </p>
