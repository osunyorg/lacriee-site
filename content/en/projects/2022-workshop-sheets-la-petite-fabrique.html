  body: >-
    <p>  <br>La Petite Fabrique  is an edition created by Line Simon. It’s a collection of 8 workshop sheets designed to create images at home, in school, alone or with others. La Petite Fabrique  follows the workshops proposed by the artist Line Simon during each exhibition of the  Lili, la rozell et le marimba  cycle (2019-2022), which focused on the relationship between contemporary creation and local craftsmanship. This collection extends the discovery of the works and can be practiced independently. It allows for the exploration of different image creation techniques: monotype, paper weaving, puzzles, collage, etc. The materials needed for each workshop can be found in a kitchen drawer or just by stepping outside. Each workshop lasts 1 hour and is aimed at children from 6 years old.</p>  <p> editor  <br>   <br>La Criée centre d'art contemporain, Rennes</p>  <p> technical characteristics  <br>   <br>8 cards, 210 copies digital color printing, kraft envelopes 8 cards, 40 copies digital color printing and vegetable ink screen printing, Japanese envelopes, charcoal and elderberry ink</p>  <p> price  <br>   <br>free</p>  <p> learn more  </p>
