It allows for the exploration of different image creation techniques: monotype, paper weaving, puzzles, collage, etc.The materials needed for each workshop can be found in a kitchen drawer or just by stepping outside.Each workshop lasts 1 hour and is aimed at children from 6 years old.</p>  <p> editor  <br>   <br>La Criée centre d'art contemporain, Rennes</p>  <p> technical characteristics  <br>   <br>8 cards, 210 copies digital color printing, kraft envelopes8 cards, 40 copies digital color printing and vegetable ink screen printing, Japanese envelopes, charcoal and elderberry ink</p>  <p> price  <br>   <br>free</p>  <p> learn more  </p>
