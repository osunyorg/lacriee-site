    <p>  <br>video, colour, sound, 12 min 28 sec screen, metal structure, 24 shoe-shine boxes collected in La Paz, Bolivia, variable dimensions</p>  <p>   <br>Conducted in Bolivia, the project La Brigada is carried out with street shoe shiners in La Paz. Both noticeable and nomadic in the city, they are the guardians of a  <br>'small trade' that is precarious and despised. Often masked to avoid  <br>recognition, they try to catch the attention of passersby by tapping on  <br>small, colorful wooden boxes. Attentive and sensitive to their  <br>conditions, Bertille Bak invited them to transform their mundane  <br>gestures into "those of a brigade defending the polished shoe, powerful  <br>and respectable." She built with the collective a new form of protest,  <br>both poetic and political. This shift from reality to fiction is  <br>amplified by the presence of their personalized and colorful work tools. <br> Bertille Bak has gathered the shoe shiners' boxes into a collection of  <br>ethnographic objects, highlighting the humanity and uniqueness of each  <br>of these invisible individuals. Production: <br> -- French Embassy in Bolivia <br> -- La Criée Contemporary Art Center</p>  <p>  </p>  <p>Photo : Aurélien Mole</p>  <p>Bertille Bak, vue de l'exposition  Dark-en-ciel , 2022 - Photo : Aurélien Mole</p>  <p> Connections  </p>
