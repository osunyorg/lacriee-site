    <p>  <br>Quatre esquisses</p>  <p>   <br>						 These four untitled sketches were created in March 2020 as part of a twinning project with the Trégain school in Rennes, where artist Amadou Sanogo led workshops with Year 5 and Year 6 classes. He presented his approach and career path to the pupils before creating a gouache sketch on cardboard inspired by the themes of his previous series: Proverbs, which, according to Amadou Sanogo, ‘help children to think for themselves’; La douche (The Shower), which addresses the issue of corruption in Mali; Spiritual companions around animist practices and Boxers (or Headless), which evokes criticism of the elites. Following the workshop, the works produced were presented at La Criée in the exhibition De paroles en paraboles on se sert (From words to parables, we help ourselves) from 26 May to 30 August 2020, which translates Bambara proverbs into paintings.  <br>					 <br>partnership: -- Académie de Rennes -- école élémentaire Trégain, Rennes support:  ville de Rennes</p>  <p> Connections with te event  </p>
