        <p><i>Festina Lente</i> consists of a megaphone whose amplifying horn is  obstructed by an ammonite of the same diameter. This fortuitous  correspondence represents for Evariste Richer 'a collision of chance.'  The work juxtaposes discourses of urgency with the silence of sediments  thousands of years old. The speech induced by the megaphone extends the  spiral of geological time embodied by the fossil.</p>
