    Revue n°3 - Festina Lente (Make haste slowly)
  summary: >-
    
  body: >-
    <p>  <br>While the succession of crises - ecological, but also post-colonial,  <br>geopolitical, etc. - seems to be accelerating, for many of us it is no  <br>longer possible to remain passive in the face of the coming collapse. It <br> is no longer possible to simply observe, see and tremble. The  <br>acceleration of crises also goes hand in hand with an acceleration of  <br>the societal and individual rhythms, to which we must submit and adjust  <br>continuously. In this context, many artists, thinkers and thinkers of art worlds reflect on forms of adaptation, alternatives and resistance. The Criée centre d'art contemporain accompanies this movement through the artistic cycle  Festina Lente (Host slowly) , which is available in exhibitions, events and residences, as well as in the pages of this review. This <br> third issue revolves around our links to the past. They are most often  <br>woven in a double movement, seemingly paradoxical, rooted and escaped.  <br>The question is how to feed on the past, but also how to resist it. Ask  <br>yourself again: can we listen to all the voices of the past? Can we  <br>escape her nostalgia and the truncated visions she generates? Finally  <br>ask yourself: how can we make the past an ally? These questions were addressed to artists, writers, philosophers, landscapers and researchers. Their <br> answers, in turn analytical or poetic, retrospective or prospective,  <br>fictional or reflecting directly lived experiences, make palpable, by  <br>mixing, the depth and complexity of the links that unite us with the  <br>past. They also point to the persistence and even efficiency of the past <br> in the writing of the present and the future. Writers Louise  <br>Bentkowski , Lucie Rico and Ryoko Sekiguchi, art historians Andréanne  <br>Béguin and Nadine Atallah, artists Léa Muller, Yasmina Reggad and  <br>Arslane Smirnov, landscape designer Lolita Voisin and philosopher  <br>Olivier Gaudin contributed to this issue.</p>  <p>   <br>The Graphic Design Formatting the journal  Festina Slot  is designed in nod to the works of Alde Manuce, an Italian humanist printer of the 17th century, who marked his works of Latin adage in the imaged form of a dolphin ( Festina ) rolling around an anchor ( Slot ). Within this issue, typographical strips adorn each of the articles and then circulate in different ways over the course of the reading. These motifs, repeated, fragmented, dispersed, oscillate at the top of the page or come to jostle the text by popping up between the words, like so many fantomatic apparitions. The alternation of text bodies reflects the cyclical movement – projections, retrospectives – that characterizes our individual and collective relationships to the past.</p>  <p> editorial directory  <br> editorial comity  <br> contributors  <br> editor  <br>   <br>La Criée centre d'art contemporain</p>  <p> diffusor  <br>   <br>Alias Sandi</p>  <p> graphism  <br>   <br>Les presses du réel ( https://www.lespressesdureel.com/ )</p>  <p> technical characteristics  <br>   <br>106 pages black & white inside pages Colour covers French format: 33 × 24 cm ISBN: 978-2-90-6890-39-8 Impression: City of Rennes and Mediagraphic Shaping: The Little Shapemaker</p>  <p> price  <br>   <br>15 €</p>  <p> learn more  </p>
