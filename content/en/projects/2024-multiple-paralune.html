    Multiple - Paralune
  summary: >-
    <p>Gabrielle Manglou</p>
  body: >-
    <p>  <br>In Gabrielle Manglou's work, the fold is a recurring gesture that questions the intertwined and necessary duality of opening and closing. The fold announces both expansion and retraction. It is in itself the boundary, the ridge, the interstice, the secret, a space-time within which grazing and distance, revelation and forgetting intermingle. Paralune is inspired by the residency Les Merveilles [The Wonders], conducted at Jean Moulin elementary school in Rennes between January and April 2024, where it was proposed to consider otherness – as a quality of what is other, in humans and non-humans (plant, animal, mineral, cosmic world) – "as a communion, a reflecting surface that would lead us to consider ecology not only as a science or political formula, but as an internal prose of the world, an incessant dialogue, an inseparability of all things and all beings, a necessary conviviality with and through the living."</p>  <p>  </p>  <p>En arrière plan le multiple de Gabrielle Manglou accroché au mur.
