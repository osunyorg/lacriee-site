    <p>  <br>For her residency on the construction site and at the Torigné school, the young Rennes-based artist Clémence Estève imagined the project  Remise en jeu . This project is inspired by archaeological accounts that have highlighted the possible discrepancies between the actual uses and functions of discovered objects and the hypotheses raised by archaeologists. The artist proposes to question this notion of error with the students, by inviting them to create "parasitic elements" that can lead to various readings or interpretations of the excavation site of the Hôtel-Dieu.  By combining art and archaeology, this project seeks to link understanding of the world and humans, and the development of creativity for each child. It offers the opportunity to cross disciplinary boundaries, to reveal the singularity and perhaps the porosity of scientific and artistic languages.  This project includes visits to the excavation site and to the Criée, research and practice workshops with the artist, and meetings with archaeologists and professionals from the Inrap. It will result in a restitution in the form of an exhibition at the Hôtel Pasteur from April 6 to 23, 2017.  Play the artist's game by mixing real relics from the Late Antiquity period from the archaeological excavation site of the Hôtel-Dieu in Rennes, discovered by the Inrap archaeologists, with everyday objects. This video game is the 3rd part of the project imagined by the artist Clémence Estève as part of her creation and transmission residency produced by La Criée centre d'art contemporain, in partnership with the Institut national de recherches archéologiques préventives and the Torigné elementary school in Rennes. It follows an exhibition and a paper edition.  <br> Credits  -- Production: La Criée centre d'art contemporain  -- Original idea: Vincent Raoul  -- Associated artist: Clémence Estève  -- Graphic design: Romain Renault  -- Programming: Julien Delampe </p>  <p> To play  <br>   <br>To download the game, click here</p>  <p> Connections  </p>
