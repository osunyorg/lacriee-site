    <p>  <br>This monograph, thought <br>in close connection with the issue of the performance archive and its <br>possible activations, traces the work carried out over a decade by <br>the transdisciplinary artist Violaine Lochu, anchored in the field of <br>contemporary art, experimental music and sound poetry, <br>with central pivot performance.</p>  <p> Considered as a book to perform, this book, <br>whose contributors have always accompanied or accompanied <br>the artist in his research, draws up a subjective inventory of the <br>languages - voice, sound, textual, visual, graphic, stage... - <br>it explores and links projects. The texts of Vanessa Desclaux and Florian Gaité, the interviews with <br>Nadine Hounkpatin, Bruno Latour, Nastassja Martin, Anne-Françoise <br>Rouche, enlighten the recent developments and the adventure of this <br>unique creative path. The book is also invested in the <br>practice that made Violaine Lochu known; its purpose and <br>materiality are « replayed » in a series of performances that <br>accompany its publication. « Performing the book » is still a <br>how to play and proliferate flows, fragments, <br>images, sounds that draw the languages of Violaine Lochu, and <br>year after year a work in perpetual renewal.  Bird, cyborg, cloud, healer, antenna, <br>Priestess, alien drag, crab, grenade, mermaid, queer buffoon... <br>The plural, mobile, abundant universe of the visual artist, <br>vocalist Violaine Lochu (born 1987 in Laval) draws his <br>of experiences and encounters initiated or experienced by <br>the artist. Since entering the art world in 2012, Violaine <br>Lochu continuously sought to push the limits of his <br>research territory and its vocabulary. First and foremost <br>and focused on the voice, his practice expanded, <br>series of proposals and exhibitions, to other mediums - <br>installation, video, drawing.</p>  <p> edited by  <br>   <br>Éditions Paraguay <br>http://www.paraguaypress.com/</p>  <p> contributor  <br> technical characteristics  <br>   <br>224 pages (ill.)</p>  <p> format : 20 x 27 cm  french texts ISBN : 978-2-918252-85-6</p>  <p> price  <br>   <br>30 €</p>  <p> learn more  </p>
