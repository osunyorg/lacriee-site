  summary: >-
    
  body: >-
    <p>  <br>The revue Lili, la rozell et le marimba accompanies the  <br>eponymous artistic cycle taking place at La Criée Contemporary Art  <br>Center in Rennes from 2019 to 2022. This cycle of exhibitions, events,  <br>residencies, and research exploring the connections between local  <br>productions, knowledge, and contemporary art. It aims to extend and  <br>broaden the questions raised by invited artists. The revue brings  <br>together contributions from artists, thinkers, and researchers from  <br>various backgrounds.Through case studies, theoretical texts, and artistic interventions, it aims to ask the following questions:-- <br> In what forms does the richness of contributions and influences between <br> so-called contemporary arts and traditional arts (crafts, artisanal,  <br>folkloric, popular, outsider, naive, etc.), between modernity and  <br>tradition, between local and global, manifest in contemporary creation?-- In what ways do artists work today from so-called local contexts?-- <br> How do artists participate in rethinking the connections between folk  <br>knowledge and scholarly knowledge, between local and global, between  <br>native and foreign?-- How do personal narratives serve as  <br>vehicles for History? Is one legitimate in speaking about a history that <br> isn't one's own? From where does one speak?-- How does one speak?</p>  <p>   <br>Revue n°3This revue focuses on artists who leave cities, who stay or settle in "the countryside": why? How? What connections do they forge with their environment? What do these artists tell us about old utopias and current dark imaginaries? The notion of vernacular is commonly linked to that of being anchored in a locality, and contemporary art to forms of international circulation (biennials, art market, etc.). Does a "vernacular contemporary art" exist, which would describe a sort of reverse movement: that of an art both sedentary and connected to various local poles in the world?-- The floor is largely given to artists: <br>-- through richly illustrated interviews: artists Aurélie Ferruel & Florentine Guédon, in conversation with Sophie Kaplan; artist Katia Kameli with Olivier Hadouchi about filmmaker René Vautier; choreographer Latifa Laâbissi with Lotte Arndt; curator Marianne Lanavère with Émilie Renard; Hassan Darsi and Florence Renault-Darsi (La source du Lion), in conversation with Sandrine Wymann;-- via portfolios and carte blanche given to artists and collectives: John Cornu and Mathilde Vaillant, Hassan Darsi, L'École Parallèle Imaginaire (Gilles Amalvi, Charline Ducottet, Emma Flippon, Simon Gauchet, Guillaume Lambert, Léa Muller, Johanna Rocard), Le Nouveau ministère de l'agriculture (Suzanne Husky and Stéphanie Sagot).</p>  <p>   <br>The graphic design projectThe revue's graphic design  <br>project is linked to the questioning of graphic and visual forms and  <br>tools present both in the habits of the contributors and within the  <br>municipal printing house that produces it. The entire graphic and  <br>typographic grid is developed with the idea of transcribing the dynamics <br> and rhythm of exchanges and orality.Download the journal for free here ↓</p>  <p>   <br>Revue n°3 « Lili, la rozell et le marimba »</p>  <p> editorial directory  <br> editorial comity  <br> contributors  <br>  </p>  <p>Directrice du Centre International d'Art et du Paysage – Île de Vassivière</p>  <p> editor  <br>   <br>La Criée centre d'art contemporain</p>  <p> diffusor  <br>   <br>Paon diffusion</p>  <p> graphism  <br>   <br>Jocelyn Cottencin, Studio Lieux Communs, Rennes, assisted by Élie Quintard</p>  <p> technical characteristics  <br>   <br>142 pagesblack & white inside pagescolor coversfrenchsize: 33 × 24 cmISBN978-2-906890-35-0</p>  <p> price  <br>   <br>15 €</p>  <p> learn more  </p>
