    <p>  <br>watercolour on paper 140 × 300 cm</p>  <p>   <br>Le monde foudroyé  is a large-scale watercolor that depicts a map of the  <br>world, with color nuances revealing the number of lightning strikes per  <br>square kilometer per year. The accompanying color chart resembles that  <br>of the light spectrum.  On the map, the areas in red and black correspond <br> to the regions most heavily affected by lightning, particularly the  <br>Democratic Republic of Congo in Central Africa and Venezuela in South  <br>America. The fine watercolor layers appear as a colored nebula, a moiré  <br>camouflage, through which the world's topography and its fires are revealed.</p>  <p> Connections  </p>
