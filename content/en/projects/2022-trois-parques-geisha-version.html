    <p>  <br>variable dimensions vegetable dye on cotton, appliqué embroidery, silk, paper, 2nd hand clothes, badge.</p>  <p>   <br>In residence in July 2022 at the women's penitentiary center in Rennes, Thomas Gaugain shared knowledge and skills with the inmates around the creation of textile and embroidered objects. The exhibition at Hôtel Pasteur is the culmination of this exchange, which was interrupted due to COVID. Based on intimate stories, wishes, or dreams, the inmates imagined textile objects that they could keep or give away. To restore the fictional potential of these objects, Thomas Gaugain proposed that they create 'augmented' versions of their creations.
