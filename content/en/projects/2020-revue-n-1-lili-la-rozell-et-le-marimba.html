    Revue n°1 - « Lili, la rozell et le marimba »

  body: >-
    <p>  <br>The journal  Lili, la rozell et le marimba  accompanies the eponymous artistic cycle taking place at La Criée contemporary art center in Rennes from September 2019 to August 2021. This cycle of exhibitions, events, residencies and research questions the relationships between productions, local knowledge and contemporary art. The journal aims to extend and broaden the questions raised by the invited artists. The journal brings together contributions from artists, thinkers and researchers from diverse backgrounds. Through case studies, theoretical texts, artistic interventions, she wishes to ask the following questions. -- In what forms does the richness of contributions and influences between so-called contemporary arts and so-called traditional arts (de faire, artisanal, folkloric, popular, raw, naive, etc.), between modernity and tradition, between local and global, occur in contemporary creation? -- In what ways do artists work today from so-called local contexts? -- How do artists participate in rethinking the links between the knowledge of the people and scholarly knowledge, between local and global, between indigenous and foreign? -- How are personal narratives the vehicles of History? Is it legitimate to talk about a story that is not one’s own? Where are we talking about? -- How do we speak? </p>  <p> </p>  <p>   <br>The number 1 In a desire both to bring a multiplicity of voices and points of view and to give the first place to hear the voice of artists, the first issue of the journal brings together: -- a general introduction text to the subject and to the project of the journal, composed in the form of a polylog, by the members of its editorial committee; -- the contributions of artists Valentin Caron, Vincent Victor Jouffe, Trinh Minh Ha, Seulgi Lee and the collective Bureau des dépositions, respectively associated with interviews or texts by John Cornu, Jean-Marc Huitorel, Lotte Arndt, Katia Kameli and Émilie Renard; -- a text by Baptiste Brun on Jacques Trovic, accompanied by reproductions of tapestries by the artist.</p>  <p>   <br>The graphic project The graphic project of the journal is linked to the questioning of forms and graphic and visual tools present both in the habits of the speakers and within the municipal printing house that produces the journal. The entire graphic and typographic grid is developed with the idea of transcribing the dynamics and rhythm of exchanges and oral tradition.  <br> Download the journal for free here ↓ </p>  <p>   <br>Revue n°1 « Lili, la rozell et le marimba »</p>  <p>Revue n°1 « Lili, la rozell et le marimba » ENG</p>  <p> editorial directory  <br> editorial comity  <br> contributors  <br> editor  <br>   <br>La Criée centre d'art contemporain</p>  <p> diffusor  <br>   <br>Paon diffusion</p>  <p> graphism  <br>   <br>Jocelyn Cottencin, Studio Lieux Communs, Rennes, assisté de Élie Quintard</p>  <p> technical characteristics  <br>   <br>124 pages  <br>black & white inside pages color covers french size: 33 × 24 cm</p>  <p> ISBN 978-2-906890-33-6</p>  <p> price  <br>   <br>15 €</p>  <p> learn more  </p>
