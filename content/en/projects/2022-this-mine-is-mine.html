    <p>  <br>three metal structures, cardboard, light wires, 120 cm × 56 cm × 200 cm each</p>  <p>   <br>Visitors are invited to climb onto three metal structures to discover luminous maps inside cardboard boxes These maps were created from drawings by children who traced their daily <br> journeys through underground mines in India and Bolivia. Each color of  <br>thread corresponds to the different strata of the galleries they  <br>traversed. For Bertille Bak, the ensemble composes  "a kind of radiography of the  <br>ground and a spotlight on these young people propelled into the veins of <br> Mother Earth. These working children are omnipresent yet invisible.  <br>This labor force is ideal here because they can slip into the heart of  <br>narrow tunnels. The project takes the opposite stance to this dramatic  <br>condition by avoiding any moralizing intent toward the viewer. The  <br>narrative offered is akin to a fable, drawing from the realm of  <br>childhood in its most innocent form. A naive and yet cynical response to <br> the right to education."
