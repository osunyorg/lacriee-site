    Les moineaux de Trégain (The sparrows of Trégain)
  summary: >-
    <p>Éléonore Saintagnan</p>
  body: >-
    <p>  <br>						 Les Moineaux de Trégain  was created as part of artist Éléonore  <br>Saintagnan's residency at Trégain Elementary School in March 2021, with  <br>the collaboration of CM1-CM2 students, Florian Berutti as  <br>cinematographer, Pierre-Yves Dubois as sound recordist, and Gabriel  <br>Mattei as composer. In 2021, Éléonore Saintagnan conducted research on birds, their  <br>ecosystems, and their relationships with humans in Brittany and  <br>throughout history—particularly in medieval Europe and under Mao's  <br>dictatorship in China. The film is inspired by a historical event: In 1958, Mao Zedong launched the "Great Sparrow Campaign" in China. In  <br>English, it sounds like a grand celebration, yet it was far from it.  <br>Soviet engineers had calculated that the ten million sparrows in China  <br>stole 25,000 tons of rice grains annually from farmers. Following a  <br>major hygiene campaign to eliminate rats, flies, and mosquitoes, Mao  <br>decided to target the sparrows, which were seen as food thieves, and  <br>aimed to eradicate them completely. He launched a propaganda campaign to <br> encourage the Chinese population to disperse the birds (…) The massacre  <br>took on a festive atmosphere. Anti-sparrow songs were invented (…) In  <br>72 hours, ten million sparrows were killed. However, the campaign had  <br>the opposite effect. Sparrows not only eat grains but also insects, and  <br>without their predators, the insects thrived. Locusts destroyed almost  <br>all the crops, leading to famine and a new human catastrophe. Éléonore Saintagnan invited the students to revisit this campaign scene, <br> drawing inspiration from the aesthetics of Maoist propaganda posters  <br>and films. During the filming, the artist and students created drawn  <br>banners, a giant piñata in the shape of a bird, and songs about  <br>sparrows.  <br>					 <br>Support: <br> -- Ministry of Culture and Communication -- Drac Bretagne <br> -- City of Rennes -- DEE <br> Partnership: <br> -- Académie de Rennes <br> -- Trégain Elementary School, Rennes</p>  <p>  </p>  <p>                     Éléonore Saintagnan,  Moineaux , filming the event with CM1-CM2 pupils from Trégain school, Rennes, mars 2021 - Photo : Benoît Mauras <br>            </p>  <p>  <br>            </p>  <p>Éléonore Saintagnan,  Moineaux , filming the event with CM1-CM2 pupils from Trégain school, Rennes, mars 2021 - Photo : Benoît Mauras <br>            </p>  <p>Éléonore Saintagnan,  Moineaux , filming the event with CM1-CM2 pupils from Trégain school, Rennes, mars 2021 - Photo : Benoît Mauras <br>            </p>  <p> Connections  </p>
