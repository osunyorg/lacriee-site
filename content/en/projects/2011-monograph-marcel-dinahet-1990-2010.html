    <p>Marcel Dinahet</p>
  body: >-
    <p>  <br>Marcel Dinahet's work is closely linked to the coastline. Since the  <br>early 80s, he has been exploring its surface and underwater landscapes  <br>with a video camera. If his early works tackled more specifically - and  <br>in an original way - sculpture, with immersive experiments on objects,  <br>the transition to the video medium is the outcome of the artist's  <br>research process.</p>  <p>  <br>From Cabo da Roca, Portugal, to Cape Wrath, Northern Scotland, Dinahet  <br>has built a route from sea charts, dedicating special attention to the  <br>path leading him to his destination. Indeed, the aim of the artist at  <br>each stopover is to film the seabed and the preparatory work conducted  <br>on site to collect climatic data and register local characteristics. The <br> study of his routes and journeys, of his mobility or immobility, of his <br> instruments and procedures, reveals an explorer, walker, sculptor,  <br>filmmaker and diver, confronting landscape, merging with elements but  <br>also bodies.</p>  <p> authors  <br> editor  <br>   <br>LIENART</p>  <p> co-editor  <br>   <br>L’abbaye de Maubuisson, site d’art contemporain du Conseil Général du Val d’Oise   <br>La Criée centre d’art contemporain, Rennes   <br>Frac Bretagne   <br>Frac Alsace   <br>Le Crac, région Languedoc-Roussillon  <br>avec le soutien du Centre national des arts plastiques (aide à l’édition <br> imprimée), ministère de la Culture et de la Communication</p>  <p> technical characteristics  <br>   <br>23 x 17 cm  <br>303 pages  <br>french – english  <br>color ISBN : 9-782359-060393</p>  <p> price  <br>   <br>38 €</p>  <p> Connections  </p>
