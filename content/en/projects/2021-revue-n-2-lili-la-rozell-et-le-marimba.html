        <p>The revue <em>Lili, la rozell et le marimba</em> accompanies the eponymous artistic cycle taking place at La Criée Contemporary Art Center in Rennes from 2019 to 2022. This cycle of exhibitions, events, residencies, and research exploring the connections between local productions, knowledge, and contemporary art. It aims to extend and broaden the questions raised by invited artists. The revue brings together contributions from artists, thinkers, and researchers from various backgrounds.</p><p>Through case studies, theoretical texts, and artistic interventions, it aims to ask the following questions:</p><p>-- In what forms does the richness of contributions and influences between so-called contemporary arts and traditional arts (crafts, artisanal, folkloric, popular, outsider, naive, etc.), between modernity and tradition, between local and global, manifest in contemporary creation?</p><p>-- In what ways do artists work today from so-called local contexts?</p><p>-- How do artists participate in rethinking the connections between folk knowledge and scholarly knowledge, between local and global, between native and foreign?</p><p>-- How do personal narratives serve as vehicles for History? Is one legitimate in speaking about a history that isn't one's own? From where does one speak?</p><p>-- How does one speak?</p>

        <p><b>The revue n°2</b></p><p>Three sets of texts and images with numerous intersections compose this second issue: a first set is built around music and song, their historical roots, their journeys and hybridizations, with contributions from Baptiste Brun on Adolf Wölfli, Marie Guérin and Anne Kropotkine about Sadok B., Katia Kameli and Nabil Djedouani on raï, Emmanuel Parent with Lewis Watts on Beyoncé; and a second is anchored in the artistic and cultural landscape of the Maghreb, with contributions from Maud Houssais and Nassim Azarzar, Guérin and Kropotkine, Kameli and Djedouani. Yet another mixes conversations echoing La Criée's exhibition program, with John Cornu and Éléonore Saintagnan, Émilie Renard and Mathis Collins. Asserting the necessary and fertile multiplicity of positions that drives it, speech is central to this issue and is expressed in the plural: the voices that carry it, its channels of dissemination, the ideas that travel through it.</p>

        <p><b>The graphic design project</b></p><p>The revue's graphic design project is linked to the questioning of graphic and visual forms and tools present both in the habits of the contributors and within the municipal printing house that produces it. The entire graphic and typographic grid is developed with the idea of transcribing the dynamics and rhythm of exchanges and orality.</p><p><strong>Download the journal for free here ↓</strong></p>
