    <p>  <br>The pattern of Au fur et à mesure (as time goes by) is directly inspired by those of the timber-framed houses in Rennes' historic city center, at Place du Champ-Jacquet.Built in the 17th century, they notably survived the great fire of 1720. They are there; standing, a bit crooked, but still there.As time passes, the environment around them changes and evolves. This multiple evokes, through the different techniques it uses, this passage of time: on one side, terracotta objects, an ancestral practice, and on the other, a laser-cut plexiglass ruler, a contemporary practice. Between the two, the drawing.
