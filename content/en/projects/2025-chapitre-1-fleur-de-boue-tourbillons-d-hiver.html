    Chapitre 1 - Fleur de boue / Tourbillons d'hiver
  summary: >-
    <p>Lucie Férézou and Margaux Janisset</p>
  body: >-
      <p> From January to April 2025, the project  <br> La multiplicité des étoiles  (The Multiplicity of Stars) brought together artists Gabrielle Manglou, Lucie Férézou, and Margaux Janisset for a year-long residency at Jean Moulin school, in partnership with La Criée contemporary art center (2024-2025).  With Lucie Férézou and Margaux Janisset, the students attended several workshops and created sculptures, collages, screen prints, paintings with colored powders, and digital embroidery, all inspired by observations of nature and the seasons. At the end of each workshop, the two artists combined their universes and incorporated the students' productions to create three series of four posters.  These posters were designed as chapters of a shared story, opening up to possible fictions. This first chapter stems from the workshops  Fleur de boue   (Mud Flower) and  Tourbillons d'hiver   (Winter Whirlwinds). For her workshop  Fleur de boue   (Mud Flower), Lucie Férézou invited Antoine Remoué, a nurseryman with a special interest in wild flora and its conservation. He guided the students in observing the soil and its tiny inhabitants. With  Tourbillons d'hiver   (Winter Whirlwinds), Margaux Janisset took the CE2 students on a nature walk around their school to collect elements for experimenting with sculpture creation.  The posters were gradually distributed, between February and April, in small format throughout Jean Moulin school and the Villejean neighborhood: at the community center, the Paul Bert circle, the Maison Verte, the library, the CCAS, the social center's children's hub, the health association, the family space at Andrée Chedid school, the neighborhood administration, the AFEV, and more. They were then exhibited throughout the month of May in the glass-enclosed spaces of the Tambour at Rennes 2 University, near the Villejean University metro exit. </p>  <p>Production : La Criée centre d'art contemporain</p>  <p> Connections  </p>
