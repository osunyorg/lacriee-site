        <p>To accompany 2023, young Rennes artist Line Simon presents <i>Terrestrial Calendar</i>, which depicts a landscape for each month. The colors suggest the chromatic evolution of flora according to the seasons.<br><br>The landscapes evoke those of the countryside, familiar to the artist and the subject of her research. This multiple, produced in an edition of 100 copies, is printed using vegetable-based screen printing on Japanese paper, using inks made from red cabbage for the sky and iris, marigold, red cabbage, tansy, pomegranate, yellow onion, avocado, mahonia, elderberry, or red onion for the bocage landscape.<br><br>Calendar details of vegetable inks:<br>January: red cabbage and bicarbonate<br>February: tansy and bicarbonate<br>March: tansy and alum<br>April: iris<br>May: red cabbage<br>June: marigold<br>July: pomegranate<br>August: yellow onion<br>September: avocado<br>October: mahonia<br>November: elderberry<br>December: red onion<br><br>Line Simon works with sculpture and printing, where the principle of experimentation guides the emergence of forms and questions the use of materials. She invites viewers to an exercise in observation through works in which the subtle and fragile variations of time, forms, and colors make tangible what usually goes unnoticed.<br><br>This new creation is part of La Criée's enhanced support for the local art scene. This support includes, notably, the production of artist multiples at very affordable prices, allowing everyone to acquire or gift art.</p>
