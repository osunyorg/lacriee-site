    Catalogue - D’une table, l’autre 2015-2022
  summary: >-
    <p>Yves Chaudouët</p>
  body: >-
    <p>  <br>The book D’une table, l’autre offers a focus on a specific period of six years in the work of the visual artist Yves Chaudouët, spanning from his invitation to become the associate artist at La Criée centre d'art contemporain in 2014 to several major works from his current production.The 128-page book is structured around a conversation between reproductions of works, analysis by art historian Claire Kueny, and design by graphic designer Stéphane Dupont. What paths did Yves Chaudouët take between La Table gronde (Rennes, 2015) and Mahaia la concordante (Pampelune, Bilbao, Bayonne, 2019-21)? What role does the public commission La ronde des Ombelles (Pompéjac, 2014-2019) play in this? Exploring the plastic, cinematic, and literary works produced between 2014 and 2021, Claire Kueny revisits the various themes and registers, showing their sensitive connections, between the intimacy of the studio and the experience of the collective. During this period, the artist seems to reach a point of equilibrium in his subjects, through intimate works like his painted portraits created in the presence of the models, as well as large interactive installations and theatrical and cinematic stagings. D’une table, l’autre is the second monographic book dedicated to Yves Chaudouët, following the book published by the Frac Limousin with Actes Sud in 2008, which concluded with the first paintings of portraits and the tables in progress.</p>  <p> editorial directory  <br> author  <br> editor  <br>   <br>Médiapop éditions</p>  <p> partners  <br>   <br>La Criée centre d'art contemporain, Rennes <br>École nationale supérieure d'art d'art et de design de Limoges <br>Centre d'art La Chapelle Jeanne d'Arc de la Ville de Thouars <br>La Forêt d'Art Contemporain, Belin Beliet</p>  <p> diffusor  <br>   <br>CED -- Distribution : BLDD</p>  <p> graphism  <br>   <br>Stéphane Dupont</p>  <p> technical characteristics  <br>   <br>210 × 247 mm <br>128 pages <br>										ISBN : 978-2-491436-40-7</p>  <p> price  <br>   <br>22 €</p>  <p> learn more  </p>
