    <p>  <br>162 × 150 cm, acrylic on canvas</p>  <p>   <br>Amadou Sanogo painted this picture at the start of the Covid-19 health crisis in March 2020 in Rennes. He depicts himself with his mouth open and his body shrouded in mist. «The painting was not inspired by a proverb, but it could be one, because it is said that you can take everything away from a stranger except their observations,’ he says. ‘It's an intangible asset that you can't see. [...] The coronavirus is like a cloud of fear hanging over people's heads. That's my view of the situation.»</p>  <p> Connections with the event  </p>
