    <p>  <br>helicopter blade, architect's pencil160 × 25 × 10 cm</p>  <p>   <br>Apocalypse and History, two works juxtaposed, include  <br>measuring tools. The conductor's baton sets the tempo of the music, and  <br>the architect's pencil sketches the dimensions of a space. These tools  <br>are associated with large and small helicopter blades that echo the  <br>centrifugal force of a cyclone. Presented here dismantled from their  <br>rotors, they are metaphors for the hour and minute hands torn from their <br> clock. The titles also refer to narratives: the grand history of  <br>Mankind and the myth of the Apocalypse, the end of times. For Evariste  <br>Richer, the two pieces resonate with the history of art: from Dante's  <br>circles of Hell to Francis Ford Coppola's film Apocalypse Now. <br>History is like geology: it adds layers or strata of narratives  <br>that settle over time, like furrows. In its acceleration, it can also  <br>generate accidents, ruins, or amnesia. Paul Virilio thus speaks of the  <br>effects of the compression of space-time: "One day, the space-time of  <br>the world will be nothing because we will have lost the extension and  <br>duration of the world due to speed. We will not have been content to  <br>gain time to travel from one point to another, but we will have  <br>especially lost the space-time of the world because it will have become  <br>too small for the new technologies. There is a considerable symbolic  <br>loss phenomenon here.* " <br>* Interview with Paul Virilio and Giairo Daghini, ‘Dromologie: logique  <br>de la course’, in Multitudes - futur antérieur 5, Spring 1991.</p>  <p>  </p>  <p>Photo : Marc Domage</p>  <p>Photo : Marc Domage</p>  <p> Connections  </p>
