    Chapitre 3 - Le chemin du pollen / Broderie numérique et patchworks
  summary: >-
    <p>Lucie Férézou and Margaux Janisset</p>
  body: >-
    <p>  <br>From January to April 2025, the project  La multiplicité des étoiles   ( The Multiplicity of Stars  ) brought together artists Gabrielle Manglou, Lucie Férézou, and Margaux Janisset for a year-long residency at Jean Moulin school, in partnership with La Criée contemporary art center (2024-2025).  With Lucie Férézou and Margaux Janisset, the students attended several workshops and created sculptures, collages, screen prints, paintings with colored powders, and digital embroidery, all inspired by observations of nature and the seasons.  At the end of each workshop, the two artists combined their universes and incorporated the students' productions to create three series of four posters.  These posters were designed as chapters of a shared story, opening up to possible fictions. This third chapter echoes the workshops  Le chemin du pollen   ( The Path of Pollen  ) and  Broderie numérique et patchworks   ( Digital Embroidery and Patchworks  ). The forms created during the  Jeux de textures   ( Texture Games  ) workshop with Lucie Férézou were photographed to serve as models for the  Broderie numérique et patchwork   workshop. The latter took place at the éduLab-Pasteur, where the students experimented with digital embroidery. Margaux Janisset invited the students to create flower stencils from their observations or imaginations. In the schoolyard, they then created a floor fresco by sprinkling colored mineral pigments along the contours of their cut-out flowers - an ephemeral installation animated by the wind and the passage of time.  The posters were gradually distributed, between February and April, in small format throughout Jean Moulin school and the Villejean neighborhood: at the community center, the Paul Bert circle, the Maison Verte, the library, the CCAS, the social center's children's hub, the health association, the family space at Andrée Chedid school, the neighborhood administration, the AFEV, and more. They were then exhibited throughout the month of May in the glass-enclosed spaces of the Tambour at Rennes 2 University, near the Villejean University metro exit. </p>  <p>Production : La Criée centre d'art contemporain</p>  <p> Connections  </p>
