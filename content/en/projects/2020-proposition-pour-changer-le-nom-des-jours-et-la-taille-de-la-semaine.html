      <p>On the occasion of his exhibition  The Shape of a Wave Inside of a Wave  that took place at La Criée in 2019, David Horvitz invited groups that came to visit the show to realise  Proposal for the Days of the Week . The objective was to rename the days. For example, Monday was renamed  Sunmonday  or  Mondayofcrêpes , and could also, as suggested by the artist, be renamed  Dayofcauliflower  or  Caulifloday. </p>  <p>In this containment we are going through, we propose you to create another sense of time. That why La Criée decided to ask to David Horvitz a re-enactment of his proposal.</p>  <p> </p>  <p>The artist propose you to take part to a participatory work from your home. This is very simple: Take a pen, a pencil, a brush or a keyboard and let your imagination go wild! Rename the days of the week and change their number. Distort, enlarge and handle time. </p>  <p>Share your inventions  #lacrieecentredart #Culturecheznous #Renneschezmoi</p>  <p>  <br>					</p>  <p> Connection with the exhibition  </p>
