    ÎLE AUX FEMMES

    <p>  <br>film, 16 min collaboration with Anne-Laure Vincent and Clémence Mimault</p>  <p>   <br>						  <br>						  <br>						 Seulgi Lee’s interest in oral transmission led him to take an interest in the intangible culture of the French regions through their repertoires of popular songs. The film  ÎLE AUX FEMMES  was shot in Trégor, on the island of women, off Port-Blanc. According to popular oral tradition, the island takes its name from the fact that the women of gull-men dried the goemon there by accessing it at low tide. In Seulgi Lee’s film, we see two women picking up the goemon, singing and dancing in the Armorican landscape at dusk. Their moving silhouettes and their improvised songs move with humor reality towards fiction. The two performance artists were freely inspired by Breton popular culture, in particular its songs, to propose another trope or diversion.  <br>					  <br>					 <br>image et montage : Pierre-Philippe Toufektchan</p>  <p> Pour aller plus loin  </p>
