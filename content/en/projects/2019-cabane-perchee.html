    <p>  <br>wood, stubble, twine and wire, 406 × 391 × 500 cm </p>  <p>   <br>In La Criée, Éléonore Saintagnan transforms space into a place of <br>village, an imaginary place that stands at the crossroads of different <br>where she worked (Japan, South Korea, Ouessant, <br>Montreuil-sur-Mer, Ballon des Vosges Park, etc.). To build the she proceeded as she did for her films, composing with the <br>local resources and available techniques. All <br>made from recycled materials, of thatch, bark <br>in close cooperation with the technical team of La Criée, students and local producers. In these spaces, Éléonore Saintagnan summons architecture <br>vernacular ( <br>in particular, the coopers' huts and thatched cottages</p>  <p>). The cabins also testify <br>of the artist's interest in the world of childhood and the origin of language. The word comes from the occitan  cabana  which designates the <br>cottage. For the English pediatrician and psychoanalyst Donald Winnicott*, <br>the cabin is "a transitional space", a playground and a place <br>mental projection of the imagination. In this case, the child or any <br>other manufacturer invents a space back from the real world. At La Criée, they give the exhibition a utopian encampment air, where <br>Eeeryone can install to discover the films. <br>* Donald Woods Winnicott,  Game and reality, potential space,  Paris, Gallimard, 1975</p>  <p>  </p>  <p>Éléonore Saintagnan, vue de l'exposition  L'Œuf pondu deux fois , La Criée centre d'art contemporain, Rennes, 2019 <br>courtesy de l'artiste © Benoît Mauras <br>            </p>  <p>  <br>            </p>  <p> Connection with the exhibition  </p>
