    La Petite Fabrique - Ateliers en famille Line Simon
  summary: >-
    <p>The family workshop is an opportunity to extend your discovery of the exhibition during an art workshop led by artist Line Simon.</p>
  body: >-
    <p>About  <br>   <br>The proposal is to discover and create a monotype image. A monotype is a printing process that allows you to make a unique print. The colour is applied to a smooth surface that will keep the ink on the surface and allow the design created on a sheet of paper to be transferred using a pressure system. This is also known as a print. As with engraving, the design will be reversed once printed. By playing with shapes, symbols and colours, Amadou Sanogo translates into paintings the Bambara proverbs that have inspired him throughout his career. Amadou Sanogo's works will be a source of inspiration for us to imagine new ‘painted wisdom’ of our own.</p>  <p> Practical informations  <br>   <br>-- for children aged 6 to 12 accompanied by an adult -- free -- 10 places available -- registration required: li.simon@ville-rennes.fr</p>  <p> Connections with the event  </p>
