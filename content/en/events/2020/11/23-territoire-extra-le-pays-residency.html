    Territoires EXTRA - Le Pays Gilles Amalvi, Charline Ducottet, Emma Flippon, Simon Gauchet, Guillaume Lambert, Léa Muller, Johanna Rocard
  summary: >-
    <p>"Le Pays" is a long-term contextual research and creation project taking shape in a rural area (the Bécherel region between Rennes and Saint-Malo) and exploring the connections between art, landscape, and agriculture. Initiated by the École Parallèle Imaginaire, it brings together two directors, a landscape architect, a visual artist, a sound poet, and two agricultural engineers to engage in a dialogue between their research and creative methodologies within a specific territory, ultimately giving birth to a "pays" (country) from a real-world landscape.  </p>
  body: >-
    <p>About  <br>   <br>At the intersection of four communes, three communes and two departments, the administrative territory of Bécherel does not correspond to the territory lived by its inhabitants. In the face of this administrative fragmentation, we began to dream of new borders that invite us to think about the notions of "local" and "live landscape". These new boundaries are designed to bring together six municipalities and gradually create a "country". The Country designates both a nation with its own political organization as a much smaller space of which one recognizes identity and belonging, a "native land" according to Eugen Weber in  The End of the terroirs  ((1984)). In the context of the relocation of agriculture and the economy, the country is questioning the local scale of research and contemporary creation processes. We are interested in how new research-action agronomic methodologies can meet and inspire artistic creation modes and vice versa. Combining ethnographic, agronomic and artistic methods, this research is born from the existing, questioning what constitutes a defined territory and territory. She works on how to view vernacular cultures and landscapes in creative processes. La Criée centre d'art contemporain is associated with this research as part of the Territoires EXTRA  program and its artistic season , Lili, la rozell et le marimba. Over several residencies since the summer of 2020, the École Parallèle imaginaire/Théâtre de Bécherel has brought together artists and researchers to study and bring to life this "Land." The project of a fictional hike is gradually taking shape: the aim is to create "imaginary borders" by forging a new path, thus rediscovering the etymological meaning of the word "walk": "a sign marking a border." The walk allows for the fictionalization of the past and future of this territory, and also for the creation of a community around a shared, situated history.</p>  <p> The artists and researchers of the  « Pays » </p>  <p> :  <br>--</p>  <p>Gilles Amalvi, writer, poet, dance critic and sound creator." -- Charline Ducottet, political scientist, study engineer with the Cultural Biodiversity and Participative Research team of INRA, research-action in agronomy. -- Emma Flippon, agronomist engineer with the Cultural Biodiversity and Participative Research team at INRA Rennes.  <br>--</p>  <p>Simon Gauchet, actor, director, scenographer and visual artist, artistic director of the Imaginary Parallel School." -- Guillaume Lambert, actor, playwright and theatre director. -- Léa Muller, landscape designer, Itinerance, landscape and urban planning workshop. -- Johanna Rocard, visual artist and co-founder of the collective La Collective. <br>She has been conducting a rural experience since 2018. <br>Conventioned by the Brittany region, the department of Ille-et-Vilaine <br>and the municipality of Bécherel, the structure works to reinvent the <br>municipal theatre of Bécherel (comune of 700 inhabitants located between <br>Rennes and Saint-Malo)) by and for a geographical and human landscape. <br>Accompanied by some 40 inhabitants of the municipality and the <br>their questioning relates to what a "theatre" is <br>located in a rural area.</p>  <p>   <br> partnerships     École Parallèle Imaginaire, théâtre de Bécherel     La maison du livre de Bécherel     Les Tombées de la Nuit support     ministère de la Culture - Drac Bretagne </p>  <p>Initiated since 2017 by the Passerelle art centers in Brest and La Criée in Rennes, and supported by the DRAC Bretagne, T erritoires EXTRA  develops around three lines of work: supporting emerging art in Brittany through production and dissemination; build a <br>artistic project with Breton territorial actors; <br>to integrate artistic emergence into an international dynamic. <br>T erritoires EXTRA   takes <br>the form of residences of research and/or creation artists and <br>is accompanied by specific mediation work, to strengthen the <br>links between the public, local partners, institutions, and project <br>artistic, with a view to transmission and awareness around <br>the presence of artists in the territories.</p>  <p> Connections with the event  </p>
