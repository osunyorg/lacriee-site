    Territoires EXTRA - Le Pays Gilles Amalvi, Charline Ducottet, Emma Flippon, Simon Gauchet, Guillaume Lambert, Léa Muller, Johanna Rocard
  summary: >-
    <p>« Le Pays » is a long-term contextual research and creation project based in a rural area (the Bécherel region between Rennes and Saint-Malo) and exploring the links between art, landscape and agriculture. Instigated by the École Parallèle imaginaire, the project invites two directors, a landscape artist, a visual artist, a sound poet and two agricultural engineers to combine their research and creative methodologies to create a 'country' based on a real territory. </p>
  body: >-
    <p>About  <br>   <br>At the intersection of four communes, three communes and two departments, the administrative territory of Bécherel does not correspond to the territory lived by its inhabitants. In the face of this administrative fragmentation, we began to dream of new borders that invite us to think about the notions of "local" and "live landscape". These new boundaries are designed to bring together six municipalities and gradually create a "country". The Country designates both a nation with its own political organization as a much smaller space of which one recognizes identity and belonging, a "native land" according to Eugen Weber in  The End of the terroirs  ((1984)). In the context of the relocation of agriculture and the economy, the country is questioning the local scale of research and contemporary creation processes. We are interested in how new research-action agronomic methodologies can meet and inspire artistic creation modes and vice versa. Combining ethnographic, agronomic and artistic methods, this research is born from the existing, questioning what constitutes a defined territory and territory. She works on how to view vernacular cultures and landscapes in creative processes. La Criée centre d'art contemporain is associated with this research as part of the Territoires EXTRA</p>  <p> program and its artistic season , Lili, la rozell et le marimba. In different periods of residence, since the summer of 2020, School "Parallèle imaginaire-- théâtre de Bécherel" brings together artists and researchers to study and raise this « Pays ». Gradually invents the project of a hike-fiction: it is a question of creating "imaginary boundaries" by creating a new path, thus regaining the etymological meaning of the word "walk": "sign of demarcation of the border". The march allows us to fiction the past and the future of this territory, but also to create a community around a local history.
