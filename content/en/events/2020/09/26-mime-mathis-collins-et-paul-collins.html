    Mime Mathis Collins et Paul Collins
  summary: >-
    <p>Mathis Collins carves wood into figures laughing or crying, mocking and mute. He begins by roughing out different planes in the thickness of boards, then gouges their surface so that the force, angle and attack of each stroke definitively mark their volumes and textures.</p>
  body: >-
    <p>About  <br>   <br>The black outlines and colours he uses to embellish these bas-reliefs <br> are likewise obtained by elimination: after painting his chosen  <br>surfaces, he sands them back, leaving only the coloured residue in the  <br>grain of the wood. In addition to being unpredictable – a knot suddenly  <br>pops out, leaving a hole – this method is slow to bring forth its  <br>smeared faces, wan street-lighting and pale sunrises. Self-taught,  <br>Collins is now a master of his craft, but he shares with practitioners  <br>of art brut a mortal horror of a vacuum. Here he has complemented his  <br>carved compositions with moving parts whose rudimentary mechanisms  <br>reveal a parade of tricolour cockades that pass for targets. <br> All this toil to produce these primitive shapes leaves Collins’s  <br>errant characters the time to clamber up from the limbo of their  <br>micro-histories to the surface of a limewood plank. Sometimes undertaken <br> bit by bit and involving the mouths, feet, noses and hats of people  <br>with sometimes no more than the costumes on their backs, this is quite a <br> journey. The launchpad, in Paris around 1680, was something between the <br> premises of the Comédie Française and the trestles of street theatre.  <br>So much for the overall picture: the theatre that took shape in the  <br>city’s fairs was the core factor in the rivalry between the Comédie  <br>Française and the Commedia dell’arte. Jealous of the popularity of the  <br> streetwise competition, the tiny élite of « the King’s troupe » persuaded <br> Louis XIV to grant them exclusive rights to on-stage dialogue in French <br> – with armed enforcement from the police. The dissident troupes,  <br>however, very quickly found canny modes of resistance: placards were  <br>displayed and marionettes and ropewalkers spoke; mimes mimed; actors and <br> actresses delivered monologues, replying from among the crowd or  <br>letting the crowd itself reply; speech bubbles were brought out; there  <br>was gibberish in Latin. Result: all sorts of gambits for subverting the  <br>academic constraints of classical theatre. For Collins the emergence of these Parisian proto-countercultures  <br>driven by working-class dissent has become an image source and the  <br>underpinning of a transhistorical narrative he has been monitoring with  <br>regard to himself and his time. This is the history of the control of  <br>voices, bodies and behaviour, impelled by a network of skilled mimes who <br> have rendered it more discreet, more nuanced and more democratic. Given <br> today’s omnipresent abuses of power, Collins resorts to all the  <br>costumes. His work is peopled by comical, solitary alter egos –  <br>artist-clown, artist-educator, artist-cop – sprung from the popular  <br>archetypes of the Commedia dell’arte, carnivals, bistros, life after  <br>dark, and  art and culture education programmes for sensitive urban  <br>areas. He is the mime who knowingly exaggerates, who works both sides of <br> the fence, gifted with an ambiguous silence. He is the watchful cop who <br> sometimes lashes out, the bureaucrat who gives orders, the mediator who <br> reconciles, the clown trying to act the buffoon, the willing public or  <br>the guy with his own idea of art. He is also his artist father, invited  <br>here to help him invent a different kind of interactive aesthetic.  <br>Through them, he mimes. A conversation about the artistic value of artistic education is  <br>taking place here between two artists, a son and a father. Each of them  <br>is also a teacher: the former in creative workshops, the latter in an  <br>art school. At issue are work processes and their reciprocal influences. In his new series,  History of Modern Art , Paul Collins looks <br> back to his art studies in Toronto in the 1970s, reproducing pages from <br> the books that impacted his training either academically or  <br>aesthetically: the school textbook  History of Modern Art  by H.H Arnason, the art magazine  Parachute , <br> a catalogue of the painter Robert Motherwell, a typographical  <br>composition guide, a grid setting out the standard canvas formats  <br>according to the pictorial genres « portrait, landscape, marine », and a  <br>page of concrete poetry. Already famous by that time was  The Medium Is the Massage  <br> (1967), by Marshall McLuhan and graphic designer Quentin Fiore, a book  <br>whose title wittily exploited a typographical error in the media’s  <br>handling of a phrase that had become a slogan:  The medium is the message.  <br> McLuhan’s theory was that the medium was the true vehicle of  <br>information, and described a form of collusion between the channel (the  <br>medium) and its content (the message). While McLuhan was paving the way  <br>for « media studies » in Canada, Paul Collins was making the transition  <br>from experimental « free schools » to university lecture theatres. The  <br>hallucinatory effects of a massage with a message can be applied to  <br>Collins’s paintings because they are based on printed documents which,  <br>in the course of their successive modulations, have both lost some of  <br>their content and gained a certain sensuality. Replicated by means of overlaid, slightly out of register grids, text <br> and illustrations dissolve into shimmering, more or less dense coloured <br> areas. In the course of its transfers from one medium to another – from <br> printed page to photocopy to canvas – the message seems to have  <br>evaporated on contact with the canvas, giving way to free-floating  <br>images. These pictorial processes show Collins returning to the printing <br> profession he learned hands-on at the same period, working in  <br>independent publishing houses. Here, in his  History of Modern Art , he recounts a personal  <br>journey in the context of a collective visual culture: in other words a  <br>late 20th-century, vernacular vision of art in a North American vein. — Émilie Renard</p>  <p> Photography of the exhibition  <br>  </p>  <p>Vue de l'exposition  Mime  de Mathis Collins, La Criée centre d'art contemporain, Rennes, du 26 septembre au 30 décembre 2020 © Benoît Mauras</p>  <p>Vue de l'exposition  Mime  de Mathis Collins, La Criée centre d'art contemporain, Rennes, du 26 septembre au 30 décembre 2020 © Benoît Mauras</p>  <p>Vue de l'exposition  Mime  de Mathis Collins, La Criée centre d'art contemporain, Rennes, du 26 septembre au 30 décembre 2020 © Benoît Mauras</p>  <p> Events  <br> Produced works  <br> Artists and curator  <br>  </p>  <p>Artiste</p>  <p>Artiste</p>  <p>Commissaire</p>  <p> Documentation  <br>   <br>Presse kit "Mime", Mathis Collins et Paul Collins</p>  <p>Press release "Mime", Mathis Collins et Paul Collins</p>  <p> Connections with the exhibition  </p>
