    Amadou Sanogo, Martin Parr, Katia Kameli, David Horvitz Artistic and cultural education - L’art à nos fenêtres
  summary: >-
    <p>La Criée centre d'art contemporain and the Frac Bretagne have joined forces as part of L'art à nos fenêtres, a scheme promoted by the Délégation académique pour l'éducation artistique et culturelle (DAAC) in Brittany and the Ministère de la Culture/ DRAC Bretagne, which offers classes an alternative way of participating, from a distance, in the construction of an artistic and cultural education pathway.</p>

    <p>About  <br>   <br>The unique context of the health crisis calls for experimentation with new ways of bringing students, works of art, and artists together, in order to ensure educational and cultural continuity. With this in mind, the DRAC and DAAC Bretagne, in partnership with La Criée contemporary art center, Frac Bretagne, and the Rennes Opera House, invite you to welcome “Art to our windows.” La Criée contemporary art center and Frac Bretagne have devised a two-part project, with proposals in the spotlight! related to their current exhibitions (Amadou Sanogo and Martin Parr) and Des Histoires partagées (Shared Stories) with a selection of works and artists combining the Frac collection with past and future exhibitions at the art center (David Horvitz and Katia Kameli). Each artist entry includes: -- Cultural resources with video clips (presentation of a work, an artistic approach, an exhibition) -- Educational resources for teachers -- Suggestions for artistic workshops to try out in class or independently And a section entitled “Seeing Music” featuring an activity or workshop combining visual art with music or songs from traditional or contemporary repertoires. The works of Amadou Sanogo and Martin Parr, for example, offer an opportunity to discover the musical environment of the artists (Malian music or English pop music), while those of David Horvitz and Katia Kameli explore the musical variations of Breton lullabies and Raï music. This online project offers an opportunity to discover the approaches of the four artists, to observe, discuss, and practice using different media (paintings, videos, photos, installations), with an intercultural and transdisciplinary outlook. It echoes the “petites cuisines musicales” (small musical kitchens) of the Rennes Opera House, which focus on traditional and classical music. Find all the content on the DAAC Bretagne website.</p>  <p>   <br>partnership:  <br>-- DAAC Bretagne, Académie de Rennes -- Drac Bretagne -- Frac Bretagne -- opéra de Rennes</p>  <p> production:  <br>-- La Criée centre d'art contemporain -- Frac Bretagne</p>  <p> support: -- for Katia Kameli's video productions: -- Ministry of Culture / Drac Bretagne</p>  <p> Connection with the exhibition  </p>
