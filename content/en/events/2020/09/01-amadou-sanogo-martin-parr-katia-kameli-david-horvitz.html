    Amadou Sanogo, Martin Parr, Katia Kameli, David Horvitz Artistic and cultural education - L’art à nos fenêtres
  summary: >-
    <p>La Criée centre d'art contemporain and FRAC Bretagne join forces in the framework of "L'art à nos fenêtres", a project promoted by "Délégation académique pour l'éducation artistique et culturelle" (DAAC) from Brittany and the Ministry of Culture/ DRAC Bretagne which offers an alternative to classes in order to participate, remotely, in the construction of the artistic and cultural education path.</p>
  body: >-
    <p>About  <br>   <br>The singular context linked to the health crisis invites us to experiment with new ways of meeting between students, works and artists, to allow educational and cultural continuity. In this perspective, the DRAC and the DAAC Bretagne, in partnership with La Criée contemporary art center, the Frac Bretagne and the opera of Rennes invite you to "L'art à nos fenêtre" (Art at our windows). La Criée centre d'art contemporain and the Frac Bretagne have imagined a project in two parts, with proposals A la Une! in connection with the news of their exhibitions (Amadou Sanogo and Martin Parr) and Des Histoires partagées with a selection of works and artists associating the collection of the FRAC with past and future exhibitions of the art center (David Horvitz and Katia Kameli). Each artist entry includes: -- Cultural resources with video clips (presentation of a work, an artistic approach, an exhibition) -- Educational resources for teachers -- Suggestions for artistic workshops to try out in class or independently And a section entitled “Seeing Music” featuring an activity or workshop combining visual art with music or songs from traditional or contemporary repertoires. The works of Amadou Sanogo and Martin Parr, for example, offer an opportunity to discover the musical environment of the artists (Malian music or English pop music), while those of David Horvitz and Katia Kameli explore the musical variations of Breton lullabies and Raï music. This online project offers an opportunity to discover the approaches of the four artists, to observe, discuss, and practice using different media (paintings, videos, photos, installations), with an intercultural and transdisciplinary outlook. It echoes the “petites cuisines musicales” (small musical kitchens) of the Rennes Opera House, which focus on traditional and classical music. Find all the content on the DAAC Bretagne website.</p>  <p>   <br>partnership:  <br>-- DAAC Bretagne, Académie de Rennes -- Drac Bretagne -- Frac Bretagne -- opéra de Rennes</p>  <p> production:  <br>-- La Criée centre d'art contemporain -- Frac Bretagne</p>  <p> support: -- for Katia Kameli's video productions: -- Ministry of Culture / Drac Bretagne</p>  <p> Connections with the events  </p>
