In December 2020, the students participate in a workshop with Mathis Collins and in a performance during the Rayon vert  Paroles, Paroles, Paroles  pensé par l’artiste and Émilie Renard. The compagnonnage continues throughout the year with conferences or meetings with the artists of the cycle  Lili, la rozell et le marimba </p>  <p>: Jockum Nordström, Katia Kameli on the occasion of their exhibitions at La Criée and Aurélie Ferruel & Florentine Guédon during their residency in Rennes.
