    De paroles en paraboles, on se sert Amadou Sanogo
  summary: >-
    <p>Amadou Sanogo presents a collection of thirteen large-format paintings at La Criée contemporary art centre, created especially for the occasion. They form a La Bruyère-style inventory of contemporary Malian society, caught between the richness of its cultural heritage and the energy and complexity of the present.</p>
  body: >-
    <p>About  <br>   <br>Amadou Sanogo's paintings, with their direct and synthetic style, are immediately recognisable: a figure (more rarely two) stands out against a monochrome background overlaid with a square or rectangle, often composed of repetitive patterns. The bodies, dark masses, sometimes fragmented, carry elements with strong symbolic value, such as flowers (to signify the importance of harmony between people) or gloves (to express the necessity of struggle). Amadou Sanogo's characters seem to be either suspended or in a precarious balance. They are imbued with a sense of questioning, even anxiety, which is softened by the choice of bold colours for the background of the canvases, the highlights of white, red or yellow, and the vibrancy of the patterns – mainly circles and dots. Almost all of Amadou Sanogo's paintings on display at La Criée are based on Bambara proverbs, a culture and philosophy that deeply nourish the artist. They also echo his daily life, whether it be questions or personal events or those related to social, political and economic current affairs. For example, Ka kun kolo di mama nika nɛkun minɛna (He was given the head but had his tongue torn out), which shows a figure sitting at a table with a tongue on it, illustrates both the Bambara proverb that gives the painting its title and a recent event: during the last Bamako photography meetings, the director of the biennial was literally silenced at the opening. Similarly, the painting Mes observations face à la situation (My observations of the situation), created in Rennes last year, a few days before the opening of the exhibition – which was in fact postponed for two months – depicts the artist as an old sage observing the fear of the people of Rennes in the face of the arrival of the Coronavirus. For Amadou Sanogo, education and transmission are fundamental human and artistic values. That is why he decided to exhibit the drawings created by the painter and children from the Tregain school in Rennes during a residency that took place in March 2020 in the second room of the art centre. Amadou Sanogo's works are both critical and humanistic in scope. Directly connected to the vagaries of everyday life, the perspective provided by their philosophical dimension is all the more striking: they are painted wisdom.</p>  <p> Pictures of the exhibition  <br>  </p>  <p>Amadou Sanogo, vue de l’exposition  De paroles en paraboles, on se sert , La Criée centre d’art contemporain, 2020, courtesy de l’artiste et de la galerie MAGNIN-A, Paris © Benoît Mauras</p>  <p>Amadou Sanogo, vue de l’exposition  De paroles en paraboles, on se sert , La Criée centre d’art contemporain, 2020, courtesy de l’artiste et de la galerie MAGNIN-A, Paris © Benoît Mauras</p>  <p>Amadou Sanogo, vue de l’exposition  De paroles en paraboles, on se sert , La Criée centre d’art contemporain, 2020, courtesy de l’artiste et de la galerie MAGNIN-A, Paris © Benoît Mauras</p>  <p>Amadou Sanogo, vue de l’exposition  De paroles en paraboles, on se sert , La Criée centre d’art contemporain, 2020, courtesy de l’artiste et de la galerie MAGNIN-A, Paris © Benoît Mauras</p>  <p> Works produced  <br> Artist and curator  <br> Connection with the exhibition   </p>
