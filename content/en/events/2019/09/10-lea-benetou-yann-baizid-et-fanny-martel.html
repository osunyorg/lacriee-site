  summary: >-
    <p>La Criée centre d’art contemporain has collaborated with a trio of artists from Rennes – Léa Bénétou, Yann Baïzid and Fanny Martel – to create « LiZellBa », a fun educational board game, which is also available in a digital version.<br>With « LiZellBa » discover the artists exhibited at the art center, enrich your knowledge, and become an apprentice curator!</p>
  body: >-
    <p>About  <br>   <br>LiZellBa  is a cooperative game that invites the public to  <br>create a fictional exhibition. It is an amusing way for people to  <br>discover and appropriate the works and themes that run through the  <br>artistic cycle  Lili, la rozell et le marimba (2019-2022) . The game is currently being used with mediators in the classes and  <br>partner venues of La Criée Art Centre, and it will soon be available, at <br> La Criée, for everyone. It can also be played at home in a digital  <br>version. In a game of  LiZellBa , players answer questions about the  <br>works, the exhibitions and the artists’ sources of inspiration and how  <br>they connect with vernacular knowledge and skills. In the board version, for each correct answer, the player draws a  <br>miniature artwork from the pot and positions it in the exhibition space  <br>on the game board. These objects are interpretations of works produced  <br>by La Criée. In the digital version, starting with an empty exhibition space,  <br>players arrange images of the artworks in it as the game proceeds. Each  <br>virtual exhibition is then photographed and takes its place in the  <br>online collection. By playing LiZellBa, you discover the artists being shown at the art  <br>centre, you increase your knowledge and, what’s more, you get to be an  <br>apprentice exhibition curator. <br> production : -- La Criée centre d'art contemporain, Rennes</p>  <p> To play online  <br>   <br>(in French) https://lizellba.org/</p>  <p> Associate artists  <br>   <br>La Criée collaborates with the trio of Rennes artists Léa Bénétou, Yann <br>Baizid and Fanny Martel for the creation of a game of artistic education <br>rolling over the cycle  Lili, rozell and marimba  (2019-2022).</p>  <p> Connections with the project  </p>
