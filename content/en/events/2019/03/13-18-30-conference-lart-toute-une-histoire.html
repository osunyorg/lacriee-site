    Conférence - L'art, toute une histoire   Ariane Michel
  summary: >-
    <p>L’art, toute une histoire (Art, a whole story), is a series of meetings offered in partnership with the Champs Libres library. In 2018-2019, three artists invite you to discover their universe, influences and inspirations, by sharing their favorites from the history of arts.</p>

    <p>About  <br>   <br>Artist and filmmaker, Ariane Michel was associated with the artistic season of La Criée,   Fendre les Flots  in 2015-2016. Whether through installations, performances or more cinematic devices, his work invites us to sensory experiences. Ariane Michel is particularly interested in the meeting points of the wild world and human civilization. These meetings often take place at parts of the world, whether they are close or distant, «natural» or «cultural», like his film and exhibition project,   La Rhétorique des marées , in 2015 at Cap Sizun. Close to the thought of the anthropologist Philippe Descola, for her the border between Nature and Culture is not obvious; Man is an Animal like others and human civilization a reign among others. Through excerpts from films, books and other floating images, she will share her universe with us. <br>partnership : bibliothèque des Champs Libres</p>  <p> Practical informations  <br>   <br>Les Champs Libres  <br>conference room Hubert Curien</p>  <p> 10 cours des Alliés, Rennes free entry without a reservation</p>  <p> Connection with the event  </p>

        <p>Artist and filmmaker, Ariane Michel was associated with the artistic season of La Criée,  <em>Fendre les Flots</em> in 2015-2016. Whether through installations, performances or more cinematic devices, his work invites us to sensory experiences. Ariane Michel is particularly interested in the meeting points of the wild world and human civilization. These meetings often take place at parts of the world, whether they are close or distant, «natural» or «cultural», like his film and exhibition project,  <em>La Rhétorique des marées</em>, in 2015 at Cap Sizun. Close to the thought of the anthropologist Philippe Descola, for her the border between Nature and Culture is not obvious; Man is an Animal like others and human civilization a reign among others. Through excerpts from films, books and other floating images, she will share her universe with us.</p>
