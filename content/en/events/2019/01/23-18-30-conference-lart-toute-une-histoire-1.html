        <p>The project of Éric Giraudet de Boudemange are generally start with fieldwork, an ethnographic experience outside the workshop. In recent years, he has focused his research on traditional games and sports in France, Belgium and the Netherlands, from which he produces new personal and poetic narratives that take the form of videos, sculptures, installations or performances. He jumped on a pole over the canals and looked for eggs of the lapwing in the Netherlands, hunted at court with horn and shouts in the forest of Fontainebleau, become a specialist in labyrinths, rugby matches or Theseus fights. Invited this year in a creation residency by La Criée, Éric Giraudet de Boudemange explores the figures of the wild man and the knight with his project  <em>Le Graal en Doom-Like</em>.  <br><br>In discussion at the Champs Libres, he shares with the public his stories and sources of inspiration, which mix as well history, literature, learned or popular cultures, landscape, biology or new media. The meeting is also an opportunity to understand his universe, through performance.</p>
