    <p>About  <br>  </p>  <p>Jófríður Ákadóttir, known professionally as JFDR, is an Icelandic singer, songwriter and multi-instrumentalist born in 1994. She is known for her solo project JFDR as well as her work with Samis, Pascal Pinon and Gangly and works closely with producer and multi-instrumentalist Shahzad Ismaily. Her latest project is a blend of cyclical guitar parts, soft minimal soundscapes, and poetic wonderings of a journey that ends where it began. Drawing from classical, folk, and electronic backgrounds, JFDR amalgamates the sounds of changing seasons, her voice a current that moves from rough seas to smooth waters. But perhaps JFDR shines the most in her capacity as a wordsmith, employing rich imagery to evoke the subtle emotions embedded in each song. </p>  <p> Connection with the exhibition  </p>

        <p>  Jófríður Ákadóttir, known professionally as JFDR, is an Icelandic singer, songwriter and multi-instrumentalist born in 1994. She is known for her solo project JFDR as well as her work with Samis, Pascal Pinon and Gangly and works closely with producer and multi-instrumentalist Shahzad Ismaily. Her latest project is a blend of cyclical guitar parts, soft minimal soundscapes, and poetic wonderings of a journey that ends where it began. Drawing from classical, folk, and electronic backgrounds, JFDR amalgamates the sounds of changing seasons, her voice a current that moves from rough seas to smooth waters. But perhaps JFDR shines the most in her capacity as a wordsmith, employing rich imagery to evoke the subtle emotions embedded in each song. </p>
