    <p> On the occasion of her exhibition at La Criée centre d'art contemporain, Euridice Zaituna Kala invited Manthia Diawara to present his film <i>AI: African Intelligence</i> at Frac Bretagne. <br>Granted permission to attend a Ndeup, a spiritual healing ceremony practiced by the Lebou people in Senegal, filmmaker and writer Manthia Diawara-with contributions from scientists and academics-explores the relationship between African possession rituals in traditional fishing villages along Senegal's Atlantic coast and the emergence of new technological frontiers known as artificial intelligence. In this convergence of tradition and modernity, he questions how we can evolve towards a more human and spiritual approach to these algorithms.  </p>

    <p>About  <br>   <br>						 <br>						 <br>					 <br>			 <br>						 <br>				 <br>			 AI:   African Intelligence  is a project by Manthia Diawara for the scientific residency program,  <br>initiated by GLUON. We invited researchers Tarek Besold (Chief  <br>Behavioral Officer, Alpha Health, Telefonica) and Raoul Frese (Professor <br> of Biophysics, Faculty of Sciences, Physics and Astronomy, VU  <br>Amsterdam) for a residency in Manthia Diawara's studio in Yene, near  <br>Dakar, Senegal. For three years, they engaged in various discussions aimed at challenging  <br>the superiority of science over the arts in the 20th century, while also <br> seeking to contest the idea that science and technology evolve  <br>inevitably and autonomously, without the possibility of being questioned <br> (known as technological and scientific determinism). For them, artists  <br>can play a role by experimentally bringing creative, critical, and  <br>societal ideas. </p>  <p> Manthia Diawara was born in Mali, West Africa. He is a Distinguished  <br>Professor of Comparative Literature and Film at New York University.  <br>Diawara is a prolific writer and filmmaker. His essays on art, cinema,  <br>and politics have appeared in the  New York Times Magazine ,  LA Times ,  Libération ,  Mediapart  et  Artforum . He has published several books on African and African-American cinema. Notable films by Diawara include:  An Opera of the World  (2017),  Negritude: A Dialogue between Soyinka and Senghor  (2016),  Édouard Glissant, One World in Relation  (2010),  Maison Tropicale  (2008) et  Rouch in Reverse  (1995).  </p>  <p>		 <br>				 <br>					 <br>		 <br>					 <br>		 <br>				 <br>--  Production Maumaus/Lumiar Cité Commissioned by Gluon, Brussels         <br>							      							     <br>							   <br>						  							   <br>						  							    <br>							     <br>							      						      		 <br>     <br>     --  Supports Snowball, Creative Europe, Horizon 2020 S+T+ARTS Programm of the European Union, Portuguese Ministry of Culture/Directorate General of the Arts        <br>							      						      		 <br>     <br>            <br>							      							     <br>							  </p>  <p> With </p>  <p>Frac Bretagne <br>https://www.fracbretagne.fr/fr/fac_evenement/projection-ai-africanintelligence/</p>  <p> Practical informations  <br>   <br>Projection at the Frac Bretagne auditorium (19 Av.

        <p><em>AI:</em> <em>African Intelligence</em> is a project by Manthia Diawara for the scientific residency program,  initiated by GLUON. We invited researchers Tarek Besold (Chief  Behavioral Officer, Alpha Health, Telefonica) and Raoul Frese (Professor  of Biophysics, Faculty of Sciences, Physics and Astronomy, VU  Amsterdam) for a residency in Manthia Diawara's studio in Yene, near  Dakar, Senegal.<br>For three years, they engaged in various discussions aimed at challenging  the superiority of science over the arts in the 20th century, while also  seeking to contest the idea that science and technology evolve  inevitably and autonomously, without the possibility of being questioned  (known as technological and scientific determinism). For them, artists  can play a role by experimentally bringing creative, critical, and  societal ideas.</p><p>  </p><p>Manthia Diawara was born in Mali, West Africa. He is a Distinguished  Professor of Comparative Literature and Film at New York University.  Diawara is a prolific writer and filmmaker. His essays on art, cinema,  and politics have appeared in the <em>New York Times Magazine</em>, <em>LA Times</em>, <em>Libération</em>, <em>Mediapart</em> et <em>Artforum</em>. He has published several books on African and African-American cinema. Notable films by Diawara include: <em>An Opera of the World</em> (2017), <em>Negritude: A Dialogue between Soyinka and Senghor</em> (2016), <em>Édouard Glissant, One World in Relation</em> (2010), <em>Maison Tropicale</em> (2008) et <em>Rouch in Reverse</em> (1995). </p>
