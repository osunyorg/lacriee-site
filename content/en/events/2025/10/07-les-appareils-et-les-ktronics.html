    Les appareils et les Ktronics Jérémy Piningre
  summary: >-
    <p>La Criée invites visual artist, author, and illustrator Jérémy Piningre for a residency focused on research, creation, and transmission at Jacques Prévert Elementary School. The artist plans to involve first- and second-grade students in the creation of a new story, following on from his illustrated book Les Fruits et les Gumes, published by Éditions 2024. </p>

    <p>About  <br>  </p>  <p> This new album will be titled Les appareils et les Ktronics (The Devices and the Ktronics) and has the following synopsis: The Gumes, who until now have lived self-sufficiently at Primeur Ponctuel, a small grocery store, will be forced to leave it to rescue one of their own. Will the outside world that frightened them so much in the first episode be as scary as they expected? Do all the monstrous creatures that they believe inhabit the outside world really exist? As their adventures unfold, they will find themselves confronted with other mini-worlds. They will meet the Ktronics people, set off on a quest for Scampettes powder, and, hopefully, rescue their friend from her predicament.</p>  <p>   <br>In this futuristic story, Jérémy Piningre anchors his narrative in  <br>social and environmental issues. With this book, he aims to address  <br>questions of mutual aid between communities and the memory of colonized  <br>territories, shift perspectives, and bring cultural differences  <br>together. "All of this is done from a child's perspective, in a gentle  <br>and humorous way, without bypassing the subjects," he explains.</p>  <p> For workshops with students, Jérémy Piningre envisions: -- collective research sessions using readings, -- songs and discussions to imagine the material that will be used to create mini-worlds, -- collecting stories and ideas to connect with what seems foreign. The cultural and linguistic diversity of the students will be a great asset in thinking about these issues. "By sticking to the principle of the Fruits et les Gumes drawings, where everything represented is conceived as small objects placed on top of each other, we could also imagine creating stackable modules to recreate drawings in a three-dimensional space while retaining the spirit of the illustrations. We could invite other artists to take the book out of its editorial context and find dance and song performances for it, as well as create large-scale set elements." The artist Aëla Maï Cabel, with whom Jeremy Piningre co-runs the micro-publishing house Cardon Luneux, will be involved in the project, creating fanzines. </p>  <p> en partenariat avec </p>  <p>édulab Pasteur <br>https://www.edulabpasteur.fr/</p>  <p>Atelier Vivarium <br>https://www.instagram.com/atelier.vivarium/</p>  <p> Avec le soutien de </p>  <p>Direction de la Culture de la Ville de Rennes <br>https://metropole.rennes.fr/</p>  <p>Ministère de la Culture / DRAC Bretagne <br>https://www.culture.gouv.fr/fr/regions/drac-bretagne</p>  <p>Ministère de l'Education nationale / DRAEAC - Bretagne <br>https://daac.ac-rennes.fr/</p>
