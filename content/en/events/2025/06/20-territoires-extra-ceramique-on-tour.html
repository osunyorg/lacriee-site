    Territories EXTRA#9 - Ceramique on Tour Travelling exhibition and artist residences
  summary: >-
    
  body: >-
    <p>About  <br>   <br>The renewed interest of artists in ceramics has been growing in recent years, whether they make exclusive use of this technique or use it among other mediums. This use of the earth shows a desire not only to rub itself with a material with many plastic possibilities, but also to use a natural material, inscribed in a very long and rich history. Wishing to show and accompany this ceramic vivacity, the centres of contemporary art Passerelle in Brest and La Criée in Rennes join forces to propose  Ceramic on Tour . Throughout the summer of 2025,  <br> Céramique on Tour  is available as creative residences at the Artbausa Space in Crozon, Finistère, and at the Aberystwyth Arts Center in Wales, as well as a travelling exhibition. The latter, for a day or a week, unfolds in about fifteen places throughout Brittany.  Ceramic on Tour  is the fruit of numerous and fertile collaborations, with invited artists as well as with partner venues.</p>  <p>The project   Céramique on Tour </p>  <p>takes place within the framework of Territoires EXTRA #9. Initiated since 2017 by the Passerelle art centers in Brest and La Criée in Rennes, and supported by the DRAC Bretagne,  Territoires EXTRA  develops around three lines of work: supporting emergence <br>art in Brittany through production and dissemination; build a <br>artistic project with Breton territorial actors; <br>to integrate artistic emergence into an international dynamic.  Territoires EXTRA  takes <br>the form of residences of research and--or creation artists and <br>is accompanied by specific mediation work, in order to strengthen the <br>links between public, local partners, institutions and project <br>artistic, with a view to transmission and awareness around <br>the presence of artists in the territories.</p>  <p> A travelling exhibition in 15 places in Brittany  <br>   <br>Ceramique on Tour  from 20 June to 28 September, there are about 15 structures of a wide variety of types and formats, spread over the four departments: places of formation, creation or artistic diffusion, libraries, centres of social action, third place, etc. In a desire to go to all audiences and to rub each other in different contexts, the two art centres have imagined an exhibition that can adapt to very different environments. Easily mountable and demountable, easily transportable, scenography, both practical, aesthetic and eco-conceived, was designed by the young Brestian designer Brendan Cornic. At each stage, Lucie Baumann, cultural mediator, offers mediation actions and adapted visitor tools. The exhibition brings together twelve artists who live and work in Brittany, seven women and five men, mostly born at the turn of the 1990s. All the pieces exhibited testify to the plurality of the ceramic practices of the visual artists today: from sculptures to re-visited utility objects, photography and video; works exploring naturalistic, geological or archaeological themes, or sound and human figure. With  <br> Ceramique on Tour , the art centers Passerelle and La Criée come out of their walls to present the emerging scene throughout Brittany, to the closest to the inhabitants. They thus implement two complementary aspects of their role as actors in the territory: support for artistic emergence and the dissemination of contemporary creation to a broad audience.</p>  <p> Pictures of the exhibition  <br>  </p>  <p>Du 20 au 22 juin à l'Espace Artbausa Crozon (Finistère)</p>  <p>Du 18 au 20 juillet à L'image qui parle, à Paimpol (Côtes-d'Armor)</p>  <p>Du 18 au 20 juillet à L'image qui parle, à Paimpol (Côtes-d'Armor)</p>  <p>Le 22 juillet au CDAS de Guichen (Ille-et-Vilaine)</p>  <p>Le 22 juillet au CDAS de Guichen (Ille-et-Vilaine)</p>  <p>Du 23 au 27 juillet à l'Atelier Marcelin, à Lorient ( <br>Morbihan)</p>  <p>Du 23 au 27 juillet à l'Atelier Marcelin, à Lorient ( <br>Morbihan)</p>  <p>Le 05 août à la Résidence des arts de Montcontour ( <br>Côtes-d'Armor)</p>  <p>Le 05 août à la Résidence des arts de Montcontour (Côtes-d'Armor)</p>  <p>Le 07 août au Musée de la Poterie, à Lamballe  <br>(Côtes-d'Armor)</p>  <p>Le 07 août au Musée de la Poterie, à Lamballe  <br>(Côtes-d'Armor)</p>  <p>Du 19 au 21 septembre à l'EESAB - site de Quimper ( <br>Finistère)</p>  <p>Du 19 au 21 septembre à l'EESAB - site de Quimper ( <br>Finistère)</p>  <p>Les 27 et 28 septembre au Patiau, à Saint-Jean-de-la-Poterie (Morbihan)</p>  <p>Les 27 et 28 septembre au Patiau, à Saint-Jean-de-la-Poterie (Morbihan)</p>  <p> Residences in Crozon (Finistère) and Aberystwyth (Wales)  <br>   <br>In collaboration with the Espace Artbausa, a new place dedicated to ceramic creation in Crozon, three artists will be welcomed for a month for a research and creation residency during which they will be able to make new pieces, accompanied by the teams of art centres and Artbausa. This is Norah Cottencin, Emilien Adage, and Bonnie Grace. In parallel, the artist Quentin Marais will be welcomed at the Aberystwyth art centre for a month, too, in October. The Welsh art centre has developed expertise in ceramics for many years and Quentin Marais will be able to compare its practice with a new and favorable context. Through these residences, the Passerelle and La Criée art centres implement their mission of supporting creation with a view to both supporting the local scene and exchanging with the Welsh artistic scene.</p>  <p> Partnerships and support  <br> A project led by </p>  <p>La Criée centre d'art contemporain</p>  <p>le centre d'art contemporain Passerelle, Brest</p>  <p> Supported by </p>  <p>Le Ministère de la Culture - Drac Bretagne</p>  <p>Institut Français+Région Bretagne</p>  <p> in partnership with </p>  <p>Espace Artbausa Crozon</p>  <p> Documentation  <br>   <br>Dossier de presse « Céramique on Tour »</p>  <p> The program  </p>

        <p>In collaboration with the Espace Artbausa, a new place dedicated to ceramic creation in Crozon, three artists will be welcomed for a month for a research and creation residency during which they will be able to make new pieces, accompanied by the teams of art centres and Artbausa. This is Norah Cottencin, Emilien Adage, and Bonnie Grace.<br>In parallel, the artist Quentin Marais will be welcomed at the Aberystwyth art centre for a month, too, in October. The Welsh art centre has developed expertise in ceramics for many years and Quentin Marais will be able to compare its practice with a new and favorable context. Through these residences, the Passerelle and La Criée art centres implement their mission of supporting creation with a view to both supporting the local scene and exchanging with the Welsh artistic scene.  </p>
