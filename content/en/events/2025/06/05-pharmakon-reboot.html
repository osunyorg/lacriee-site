    Pharmakon / Reboot Violaine Lochu
  summary: >-
    <p>                      Exploring voice and language as well as notions of transformation and transposition, Violaine Lochu has developed an artistic practice at the crossroads of the visual arts, experimental music and sound poetry. Her solo exhibition at La Criée, <i>Pharmakon / Reboot</i> unfolds around healing songs, gestures and thoughts. It is conceived as an ensemble in which video-performances, costume-partitions, drawing-writing, sound pieces and site-specific performances interact.       </p>

    <p>About  <br>  </p>  <p>How does art help us to resonate with ourselves and <br>others? And to take care of those, and everything, around us? These questions, <br>which have underpinned Violaine Lochu's work in recent years, are at the heart <br>of the  Pharmakon / Reboot  exhibition. </p>  <p>In response, the artist poses another question, simple <br>and direct, yet one that opens up worlds, even abysses: what would you like to <br>heal?  Interested in the interactions between humans and <br>plants, the artist has conducted research in several stages to explore these <br>questions. She met with herbalists, ethnobotanists and magnetisers in Mayenne. <br>She also listened to and collected stories from people in Rennes suffering from <br>various ailments, both before and during the exhibition. It is this collected <br>material that she translates, transposes and recomposes to create new musical <br>and visual compositions. The  Pharmakon / Reboot  exhibition has a strong <br>ritual dimension, drawing on local and distant indigenous knowledge as much as <br>it fits into the recent history of performance art. The performers will engage <br>in healing rituals at the opening and closing of the exhibition. The art <br>centre's reception and mediation team will also perform regular healing rituals <br>throughout the exhibition, based on wishes submitted by visitors. The artist <br>and the institution are reflecting on, and sharing, new ways of presenting and <br>transmitting art.  With  Pharmakon / Reboot , Violaine Lochu lays bare her own voice in <br>order to recompose, to make heard and to accompany our ills. The central <br>questions addressed by the artist in this exhibition prompt others: How can <br>modern and vernacular gestures and knowledge merge and complement each other? <br>How can an exhibition welcome and listen? Can a work of art be both intimate <br>and collective, poetic and political? </p>  <p> Pharmakon / Reboot  offers a reflection on the decompartmentalisation <br>of forms and practices - artistic, medical, social - made possible by the <br>pooling of knowledge and the (re)invention of healing gestures</p>  <p> Events  <br> Artist and curator  <br>  </p>  <p>Artiste</p>  <p>Commissaire</p>  <p> Connection with the exhibition  </p>
