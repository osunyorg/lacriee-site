    Rythmes et cadences with the Alphonse Pelé professional high school in Dol-de-Bretagne
  summary: >-
    <p>In connection with La Criée's 40th anniversary season and in dialogue with art professionals and an artist, students in their first year of the Bac Pro Technicien Menuisier Agenceur (Professional Carpentry and Interior Design Technician) program are putting together an exhibition of video and digital works produced by La Criée between 1986 and 2024.</p>
  body: >-
    <p>About  <br>  </p>  <p> The exhibition addresses an urgent question today : the pace and rhythm of modern life and the appropriation of time (time for obligations/time for oneself, speed/slowness, wasting time/taking time, etc.). To do this, students explore the archives of La Criée, become exhibition curators, and produce educational materials. They also become cultural mediators by helping to promote the exhibition within their school. Starting in September 2026, this exhibition will be proposed and distributed to schools in the Academy that wish to host it, particularly those with a Galerie Arc-en-ciel.</p>  <p> support --   DRAEAC / Adage</p>  <p> --   Karta / région Bretagne</p>
