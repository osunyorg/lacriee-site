    Le matin les champs de fleurs et la lune emotive #2 (The morning, the fields of flowers and the emotional moon)
  summary: >-
    <p>An exhibition by Margaux Janisset and Lucie Férézou with third-grade students from Jean Moulin School in the windows of Building O - Tambour at the University of Rennes.</p>
  body: >-
    <p>About  <br>   <br> At the end of the creative and educational residency  La multiplicité des étoiles (The Multiplicity of Stars) , led by artists Gabrielle Manglou, Lucie Férézou, and Margaux Janisset throughout the 2024-2025 school year at the Jean Moulin school, La Criée is partnering with the cultural department of Rennes 2 to exhibit posters created during workshops with third-grade students.  During this project, the artists invited the pupils to discover the production of multiples, posters, and handmade objects produced in limited editions, drawing inspiration from nature, the seasons, and their environment, both near and far. From January to April 2025, Lucie Férézou and Margaux Janisset led workshops in classrooms, in the gardens of Villejean and Thabor, and at the Edulab-Pasteur, accompanied by La Criée and nurseryman Antoine Rémoué. The students observed and reinterpreted the flora and fauna, using various techniques: collage, painting with mineral powders, cyanotype, sculpture, drawing on tracing paper, risograph fanzines, etc.  At the end of each workshop, Lucie Férézou and Margaux Janisset combined their worlds and incorporated the students' work to create three series of four posters. These were conceived as chapters in a story to be shared, opening up possibilities for fiction. The posters were gradually distributed in small format at the Jean Moulin school and throughout the Villejean neighborhood: at the community center, the Cercle Paul Bert, the Maison Verte, the library, the CCAS and the social center's children's section, the health association, the family center at the Andrée Chedid school, the neighborhood office, the AFEV, etc. For the presentation at the Jean Moulin school on April 29, the posters were printed in large format by the Imprimerie de la Ville de Rennes alongside the students' work and various pieces by artists:  Paralune  by Gabrielle Manglou,  Flower in December  by Lucie Férézou, and  Pollen  by Margaux Janisset. From April 30 to May 28, 2025, in partnership with the cultural department of Rennes 2, the twelve posters will be on display for all to see in the windows of Building O at Rennes 2 University, visible from the Villejean Université metro station. The poetic title Le matin, les champs de fleurs et la lune émotive (In the morning, fields of flowers and the emotional moon) was chosen by the third-grade students, in reference to their multiple inspirations and stories. <br>The La multiplicité des étoiles project received support from the Ministry of Culture/Drac Bretagne, the City of Rennes/DEE, and the Ministry of National Education/DRAEAC. It was carried out in partnership with Edulab-Pasteur and Villejean Educational Success.</p>  <p>  </p>  <p>IN PARTNERSHIP WITH</p>  <p>édulab Pasteur <br>https://www.edulabpasteur.fr/</p>  <p>DRA EAC - Bretagne / L'Académie de Rennes <br>https://daac.ac-rennes.fr/</p>  <p>  </p>  <p>WITH THE SUPPORT OF</p>  <p>DEE / Réussite éducative / Ville de Rennes <br>https://metropole.rennes.fr/</p>  <p>Ministère de la Culture / DRAC Bretagne <br>https://www.culture.gouv.fr/fr/regions/drac-bretagne</p>  <p> Pictures of the exhibition  <br> Connections  </p>
