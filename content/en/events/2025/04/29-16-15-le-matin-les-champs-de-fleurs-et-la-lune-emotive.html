    le matin les champs de fleurs et la lune emotive (The morning, the fields of flowers and the emotional moon)
  summary: >-
    <p>The exhibition presents the works by artists Gabrielle Manglou, Lucie Férézou and Margaux Janisset and the students of CE2  classes of Lucie Ory, Valentine Huet-Texier and Marine Jourdan, as part of the project <i>The multiplicity of stars </i>(2024-2025).  This project focused on the discovery and creation of multiples:  series works limited, which can take the form of posters or hand-made objects.</p>
  body: >-
    <p>About  <br>   <br>November to December <br>2024, the students conducted workshops with Gabrielle Manglou, in the <br>extension of residence  Les Merveilles  at the Jean Moulin school (2023-2024).</p>  <p>At that time, she <br>suggested that students pay attention to their environment and consider <br>otherness, as a quality of what is other, in humans and <br>non-human (plant world, animal, mineral, cosmic). His residence <br>inspired the work  Paralune , made of folds of images <br>printed in white on black paper.</p>  <p>From the discovery <br>the students experienced the creation of their own multiple, <br>with photographs of workshops printed on coloured papers. They have <br>then shot their sculpture in form <br>signs. January to April 2025, <br>students discovered new artistic approaches with artists <br>Lucie Férézou and Margaux Janisset. Both have designed workshops in <br>correspondence, like the chapters of a story with several voices.</p>  <p>From <br>the observation of nature and seasons, the students realized <br>sculptures, collages, paintings with coloured powders, <br>fanzines, silkscreens, cyanotypes (impressions in sunlight) <br>and digital embroidery. These workshops took place in different spaces, <br>the school, in the courtyard, at the teacher-pastor or at the Thabor park and were <br>punctuated by visits to exhibitions in La Criée. 2Each workshop session <br>has given rise to the creation of posters, mixing the universes of artists with those of <br>Students. These were broadcast in three stages, between February and April. <br>at school and in several partner places on the Villejean district. To <br>from these mysterious posters, the students imagined stories that <br>are to be discovered in the corridors of the school. In your turn, you can <br>to tell new stories about these posters, which will be exhibited in <br>during the month of May, in the glass spaces of Tambour at Rennes University <br>2, close to the exit of the metro Villejean university. These workshops also inspired <br>to artists Lucie Férézou and Margaux Janisset, the creation of multiple editions <br>each 100 copies:</p>  <p> Flower in December  is an aluminum flower, paraffin and rose petals, which recalls the effect <br>frozen herbs in the winter ice. Its shape takes over the contours <br>a seed of charcoal, symbol of metamorphosis.  Pollen  <br>is a screen printed poster from pink ink and quartz powder, mica, pollen, <br>Shell and glass. This work evokes the iridescent reflections <br>Water on the beach on a summer night.</p>  <p>The Cree art center <br>contemporary and the Jean Moulin school warmly thank the artists, <br>students and all project partners:</p>  <p>workshops <br>extracurricular and parental spaces of the schools Jean Moulin and Andrée Chedid, <br>the Educational City of Villejean, the Child Education Directorate / the Directorate <br>Culture / the NO District Directorate of the City of Rennes;</p>  <p>The Rennes Academy / DRAEAC, the Ministry of <br>Culture / Drac Bretagne; the teacher-pastor, the cultural service of the university <br>Rennes 2, Villejean Quarter House, Green House, Paul Circle <br>Bert, the library, AFEV, EHPAD Raymond Thomas, the childhood center of <br>social centre of Villejean, the health association house, Future Health Villejean <br>Beauregard, the medical-psychological center.</p>  <p>The exhibition at the school will be extended on the glass spaces at the Drum of Rennes University 2 from 30 April to 28 May. <br>Due to the Vigipirate plan, please confirm your attendance with the school at  ecole.0352207J@ac-rennes.fr  or with La Criée at  la-criee@ville-rennes.fr </p>  <p>  </p>  <p>IN PARTNERSHIP WITH</p>  <p>édulab Pasteur <br>https://www.edulabpasteur.fr/</p>  <p>DRA EAC - Bretagne / L'Académie de Rennes <br>https://daac.ac-rennes.fr/</p>  <p>  </p>  <p>WITH THE SUPPORT OF</p>  <p>DEE / Réussite éducative / Ville de Rennes <br>https://metropole.rennes.fr/</p>  <p>Ministère de la Culture / DRAC Bretagne <br>https://www.culture.gouv.fr/fr/regions/drac-bretagne</p>  <p> Connections  </p>

        <p>November to December 2024, the students conducted workshops with Gabrielle Manglou, in the extension of residence<i> Les Merveilles </i>at the Jean Moulin school (2023-2024).  At that time, she suggested that students pay attention to their environment and consider otherness, as a quality of what is other, in humans and non-human (plant world, animal, mineral, cosmic). His residence inspired the work <i>Paralune</i>, made of folds of images printed in white on black paper.  From the discovery the students experienced the creation of their own multiple, with photographs of workshops printed on coloured papers. They have then shot their sculpture in form signs. January to April 2025, students discovered new artistic approaches with artists Lucie Férézou and Margaux Janisset. Both have designed workshops in correspondence, like the chapters of a story with several voices.  From the observation of nature and seasons, the students realized sculptures, collages, paintings with coloured powders, fanzines, silkscreens, cyanotypes (impressions in sunlight) and digital embroidery. These workshops took place in different spaces, the school, in the courtyard, at the teacher-pastor or at the Thabor park and were punctuated by visits to exhibitions in La Criée. 2Each workshop session has given rise to the creation of posters, mixing the universes of artists with those of Students. These were broadcast in three stages, between February and April. at school and in several partner places on the Villejean district. To from these mysterious posters, the students imagined stories that are to be discovered in the corridors of the school. In your turn, you can to tell new stories about these posters, which will be exhibited in during the month of May, in the glass spaces of Tambour at Rennes University 2, close to the exit of the metro Villejean university. These workshops also inspired to artists Lucie Férézou and Margaux Janisset, the creation of multiple editions each 100 copies:  <i>Flower in December</i> is an aluminum flower, paraffin and rose petals, which recalls the effect frozen herbs in the winter ice. Its shape takes over the contours a seed of charcoal, symbol of metamorphosis. <i>Pollen</i> is a screen printed poster from pink ink and quartz powder, mica, pollen, Shell and glass. This work evokes the iridescent reflections Water on the beach on a summer night.
