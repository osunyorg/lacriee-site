    Le voyage dans la Lune (Journey to the Moon) Marcel Dzama
  summary: >-
    <p>                      From 14 February to 16 May 2026, La Criée is presenting an exhibition by Marcel Dzama, an internationally renowned Canadian artist based in New York, but rarely exhibited in France.  Entitled <i>Le voyage dans la Lune </i>(A Trip to the Moon), in homage to Georges Méliès, the magician of early cinema, it presents for the first time in Europe a wide selection of the artist's films, accompanied by a collection of storyboards, drawings, models and sculptures.      </p>

    <p>About  <br>  </p>  <p> </p>  <p> </p>  <p>Having attended <br>art school in his hometown of Winnipeg and been immersed in alternative popular <br>cultures from the outset (notably through his involvement in rock bands and <br>production of numerous fanzines), Marcel Dzama has been developing a prolific <br>and joyful body of work since the late 1990s, in which drawing and film are <br>central. </p>  <p> </p>  <p> </p>  <p>A great admirer <br>and connoisseur of early cinema, from which many of his films borrow elements <br>such as black-and-white imagery and expressionist gestures, Marcel Dzama is, in <br>a broader sense, curious about a variety of creative worlds: the surrealist <br>spirit, early modernism, pop culture, illustration, underground music, etc. <br>These references, whether recognisable or not, fuel a fantastical universe - <br>immediately identifiable in itself - that is sometimes magical, sometimes <br>cruel, sometimes poetic, sometimes political.</p>  <p> </p>  <p> </p>  <p>The exhibition  Le <br>voyage dans la Lune  (A Trip to the Moon) features around fifteen films. During <br>an hour-long programme devised by the artist, visitors can discover films from <br>his youth, films shot on the spur of the moment, others featuring his son and <br>father, and still others produced as commissions. Humour and inventiveness <br>imbue this selection with the same energy. Marcel Dzama has also chosen to <br>highlight two films, presented in two dedicated screening rooms:  Une danse des <br>bouffons  (A Jester's Dance) (2013) and  To live on the Moon (for Lorca)  <br>(2023). The first is inspired by the love story between Marcel Duchamp and <br>sculptor Maria Martins, the second by the figures in the moon and poet Federico <br>García Lorca.</p>  <p> </p>  <p> </p>  <p>In parallel to the <br>films, objects, sculptures, masks, drawings, models and storyboards are <br>presented in the central space of the art centre. Whether it be costumes, <br>pieces of scenery or sketchbooks taken directly from the films, or drawings <br>created elsewhere, we find the same inspirations and the same humour in both <br>colour and line.</p>  <p> </p>  <p> </p>  <p>From pencil to lens, from poetry to politics, Dzama <br>plays with the codes and history of burlesque and fantasy with the virtuosity <br>of a tightrope walker. His works combine references and virtuoso pirouettes <br>with a pleasure, freedom and joy that we trust will prove contagious.</p>  <p> partnerships </p>  <p>Centre Culturel Canadien - Paris <br>https://canada-culture.org/</p>  <p> Artist and curator  </p>
