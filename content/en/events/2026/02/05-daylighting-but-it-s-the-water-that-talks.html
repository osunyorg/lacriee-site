    Daylighting: But it's the water that talks Euridice Zaituna Kala
  summary: >-
    <p> As part of its itinerancy, the exhibition <em>Daylighting : mais c'est l'eau qui parle </em>  by Euridice Zaituna Kala, initially presented at La Criée centre d'art  contemporain (Rennes, France), is now installed at La Loge in Brussels.  In her work, Euridice Zaituna Kala seeks out and highlights the  multiplicity of narratives within historical periods that are sometimes  opaque. This exhibition explores the relationship in a continuum between  water, nature, and human narratives.  </p>
  body: >-
    <p>About  <br>   <br>Through a moving installation that includes industrial and blown glass,  <br>transparent images, coloured lights, ancient seeds and multilingual  <br>narratives, Euridice Zaituna Kala delves into the past of people and  <br>ecosystems - such as that of the fully covered Senne River in Brussels - <br> that once thrived in urban areas. By attempting to establish new links  <br>between these contexts, she challenges the dominant vision of the city,  <br>which is purely growth-oriented.</p>  <p>  </p>  <p>A touring exhibition co-produced with</p>  <p>La Criée centre d'art contemporain <br>https://www.la-criee.org</p>  <p>La Loge <br>https://www.la-loge.be/fr</p>  <p> Artist  <br> Connections with the exhibition  </p>
