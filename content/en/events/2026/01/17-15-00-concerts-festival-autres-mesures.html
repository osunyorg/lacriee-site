    Concerts - Festival Autres Mesures Kimu Txalaparta
  summary: >-
    <p>The txalaparta is a traditional Basque instrument that resembles a xylophone. Legend has it that players find the initial rhythm in their heartbeats. And that is surely where the duo formed by Txomin and Sergio, known as Kimu txalaparta, finds its inspiration: in their hearts and bodies.</p>
  body: >-
    <p>About  <br>   <br>Txalaparta is a percussion instrument that originally consisted of a thick wooden board, chosen for its sound and ability to vibrate. Playing it encourages communication and exchange because it is based on mutual listening. It transcends theory to appeal to all ears. Txalaparta is the sound of wood resonating like the echo of a horse galloping at the bottom of a valley in the Basque Country. Within the art center, in resonance with Hélène Bertin's installation, Txomin and Sergio will make the sounds of this traditional Basque instrument dance, reminiscent of those of the xylophone or balafon. A meeting of rituals, certainly relevant and necessary in our decade. </p>  <p> Connection with the event  </p>

        <p>Txalaparta is a percussion instrument that originally consisted of a thick wooden board, chosen for its sound and ability to vibrate. Playing it encourages communication and exchange because it is based on mutual listening. It transcends theory to appeal to all ears. Txalaparta is the sound of wood resonating like the echo of a horse galloping at the bottom of a valley in the Basque Country. Within the art center, in resonance with Hélène Bertin's installation, Txomin and Sergio will make the sounds of this traditional Basque instrument dance, reminiscent of those of the xylophone or balafon. A meeting of rituals, certainly relevant and necessary in our decade. </p>
