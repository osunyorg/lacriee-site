summary: >-
  <p>The work of Mozambican artist Euridice Zaituna Kala focuses on metamorphosis, manipulation and cultural adaptation, and historical. In the continuity of Senghor's idea to find and building "the kingdom of childhood", it reproduces the visual vocabulary of historical archives to reveal their absences and subjectivities, and those they have invisibility. Supporting on research, its practice is protein: performance, installations, photographs, texts, videos, sculptures/landscapes, sound works, etc.  </p>

        <p>Exposure from Euridice Zaituna Kala to La Criée centre d'art contemporain proposes a reflection on the modern city, how developments Infrastructural and architectural projects have been largely buried, driven away and often completely destroyed the natural and human ecosystems preceding it. She questions in particular glass architectures, heterotopies<a href="#_ftn1" title=""></a>*<a href="#_ftn1" title=""></a> and the worldviews they reflect. She is also interested in current projects and, through them, the place left to minorities. </p><p>In the following a residence in New York and his personal exhibition at the gallery Anne Barrault, the exhibition at La Criée will take as a support point New York, the ultra-city, the dream city par excellence. It will also feed on a exploration of Rennes, the history of its settlement, its urbanization and ties (de)woven with nature, especially with its river. </p><p>From of documents, conversations and walk-throughs New York and Rennes, Euridice Zaituna Kala will compose a story that features an exploration of the archive in urban space. Through sculptures of glass mixing images and reflections, it shapes a representation of this space inspired by the historical and current mapping of New York Rennes, and thus proposes new geographies which take account of the architectural changes in relation to a sensitive ecosystem. <br><br>Using cinema techniques such as the American night**, she also develops a series of images that talk about an imagined map, the revelation of water and the iconography of the future. These images question contemporary traces of the presence of indigenous peoples, as much as they make contemporary minorities visible. </p>

        <p>* Heterotopia is a <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept_(philosophie)" title="Concept (philosophie)">concept</a> forged by <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Foucault" title="Michel Foucault">Michel Foucault</a>in a 1967 conference entitled "Other Spaces". There defines heterotopies as a physical location of the<a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utopie" title="Utopie">utopia</a>. This are concrete spaces that house the imagination, like a children's cabin or a theatre. They are also used for exclusion, as are retirement homes, asylums or cemeteries. More generally, they can be defined in the use of space intended to accommodate a type sports stadiums, places of worship, parks of attraction are in this category. These are in short places to within a society that obeys rules that are different. </p><p>** "U.S. night" is referred to as the camera system that allows shooting a night scene in the middle of the day, thanks to the use of various filters.</p>
