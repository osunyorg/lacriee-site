    Rayon vert - exposition et concert - Correspondance Mazen Kerbaj et Laure Ghorayeb
  summary: >-
    <p>La Criée contemporary art centre invites Spéléographies for a weekend. The exhibition presents Mazen Kerbaj's graphic and handwritten correspondence with Laure Ghorayeb.</p>
  body: >-
    <p>About  <br>   <br>Carried out on 35-centimetre rolls of paper that the two protagonists send to each other by post, this exchange between son and mother, written and drawn in French and Arabic, combines confidences and reflections, revealing a surprising artistic and familial exchange. Mazen Kerbaj is a comic book author and musician. A trumpet player and well-known figure on the Lebanese improvised music scene, he will be giving a concert as part of the  Correspondance  exhibition. An internationally renowned artist from a country with no tradition of comic books, he is best known in France for  Beyrouth, juillet – août 2006  (Beirut, July–August 2006), published by L'Association, which features drawings posted on his blog during the Israeli bombing of Beirut in 2006. In 2013,  <br> Lettre à la Mère  (L’Apocalypse) was published, a collection of short stories which, through frequent references to his hometown, deal with the passing of time in multiple forms. Laure Ghorayeb lives in Beirut. A poet and painter, she began her career working in art journalism. Passionate about literature, she has produced poetic works in French and prose works in Arabic. She lives her art with every fibre of her being, sometimes through colour, line and brushstrokes, sometimes through the total sincerity of her words. Laure Ghorayeb has a very personal way of expressing herself when she draws: a kind of whisper that allows her to initiate and continue a dialogue with others. <br>partnership : Spéléographies – biennale des écritures, Rennes (biennial writing festival, Rennes)</p>
