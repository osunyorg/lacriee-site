        <p>The residency she will be running there throughout the 2023-2024 season, at the invitation of La Criée, will enable her to invite other artists, researchers and experimenters, as well as neighbouring farmers and hunters, schoolchildren and students, to share their experiences and thoughts on the subject of regeneration. This pooling of approaches and viewpoints will contribute to building links and alliances between species, landscapes and practices.</p><p>The question is: what constitutes art? A practice of observation? A practice of seeding and rooting? A practice of repairing and regeneration?</p>

      notes: >-
        <p>The residency of Léa Muller and her guests is part of Territoires EXTRA #7</p>
