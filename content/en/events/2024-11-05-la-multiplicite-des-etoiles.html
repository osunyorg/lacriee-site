        <p>In the continuation of the project<i> Wonders</i> which took place in early 2024, the students of the Jean Moulin school will conduct new workshop sessions with artist Gabrielle Manglou from November to December 2024. It will propose protocols inspired by a work combining printed images and materials collected in nature. It is currently being produced and will be published in limited edition in November. Students will be able to find the artist, share their memories and discover the purpose of the <i>Wonders </i>with the work produced. <br><br>Between January and May 2025, students will also be able to understand new artistic approaches. Margaux Janisset and Lucie Férézou both lead a pictorial practice and <i>in situ</i> very inspired by the nature and environment in which they work. They also develop correspondence practices and are particularly interested in micro-publishing.<br><br>For the Jean Moulin school, they imagine several forms of workshops around the creation of paintings, posters or embroidery in small formats, which can be broadcast on the walls of the school and outside, on a district scale. They will conduct in parallel or alternately different workshop sessions with the two classes of CE2 in order to produce a common object or echo. This will take the form of one or more multiples that can be disseminated to the parents of students and within La Criée.</p>
