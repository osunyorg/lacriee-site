    Grand Air Judith Kakon
  summary: >-
    <p>La Criée centre d’art contemporain, in partnership with the Centre culturel suisse. On Tour, is presenting Swiss artist Judith Kakon’s first solo exhibition in France.</p>
  body: >-
    <p>About  <br>   <br>In the wake of the holiday season Kakon, whose work revolves around  <br>the porosity between public and gallery space, and questions of usage,  <br>re‑use and circulation, is showing part of the City of Rennes’ Christmas <br> illuminations. The decorations are being displayed « dormant », that is to say  <br>switched off and laid out on racks. Inspired by warehouse shelving  <br>systems, these racks are designed as artefacts combining sculptures and  <br>utilitarian objects. In this way the exhibition blurs the boundaries  <br>between stockroom and gallery, interior and exterior, the beautiful and  <br>the useful. Removed from their habitual context and metamorphosed in terms of  <br>form and function, these samples of urban heritage are seen in a new  <br>light by visitors to the exhibition, some of whom have doubtless  <br>wondered what becomes of the Christmas lights once the celebrations are  <br>over. This change of focus also reconfigures the art centre and our  <br>expectations of an exhibition: for once it is not the art that moves out <br> into the public space, but the streets of the city that infiltrate the  <br>white cube. This reconfiguration leads us to ask ourselves what we are  <br>looking at: Can a shelf be a sculpture? What are the sculptural  <br>qualities of Christmas lights? What models do they borrow from and what  <br>do they tell us about the circulation of forms? Moreover, Judith Kakon’s project resonates doubly in the present  <br>context: at a time of energy restrictions the dormant lights of this  <br>eco‑responsible use/re‑use of local resources shine with a powerful  <br>symbolic charge. In the cabinet adjoining the main room, the  GRAND AIR   <br>exhibition continues with a display of works on paper. The different  <br>series on show reflect the artist’s ongoing concerns: the transformation <br> of a standardised form or motif (an umbrella, a parcel scan, etc.) into <br> a unique artistic object; the interconnection between individual  <br>experiences and normative contexts; and the polysemy and fluidity of  <br>images. With  GRAND AIR , Judith Kakon’s subtly political art offers  <br>us the opportunity to look at the objects, slippages and relationships  <br>of our globalized world, by displacing our usual perspectives and  <br>geographical notions, and by calling on us to reconsider what is behind  <br>and beside what we hold as seen.</p>  <p> partnership </p>  <p>Centre Culturel Suisse.
