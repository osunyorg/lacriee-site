    Léa Bénétou, Yann Baïzid, Fanny Martel, Jean-Marc Bullet, Léo Brival, Arthur Francietta îlots ekspo Reasearch Residency
  summary: >-
    <p>Îlots ekspo is a project that associates the art centers La Criée center d’art contemporain in Rennes, the Station culturelle in Martinique and the Pyepoudre cultural center in Haiti.This residency exists to create a Caribbean version of the artists’ game LiZellBa, imagined for La Criée in 2021-2022.</p>

    <p>About  <br>   <br>The title  îlots ekspo  evokes the Caribbean archipelago but also refers to game boards that can feature multiple exhibitions, called  ekspo  in Martiniquan and Haitian Creole. The Caribbean version of  LiZellBa  will exist both physically and digitally, starting with a collection of works by around fifteen artists from the Martiniquan art scene. In March 2023, the three artists Léa Bénétou, Yann Baïzid, and Fanny Martel, who created the original game, will be in residence in Martinique. Accompanied by cultural mediators from La Criée and La Station Culturelle, the trio will collaborate with Martiniquan artists: Jean-Marc Bullet, artist and designer; Arthur Francietta, graphic designer; and Léo Brival, web developer. In September 2023, they will be joined by Max Robenson Vilaire Dortilus, director of the Pyepoudre Cultural Center, along with an invited Haitian artist. The residency provides an opportunity to exchange knowledge and expertise in the production of artworks (between art and craftsmanship), training in exhibition-related professions, and artistic and cultural mediation. The production of the game, titled in Creole  Mèt-an-Mizé , will continue throughout the year, with an expected release in 2024. The title  Mèt-an-Mizé : Inspired by  mèt manioc , an expression in the Antilles referring to the guardian of the traditional know-how of handmade cassava bread ( kassav ) produced from manioc, it more broadly denotes an expert in a particular field.  Mizé  is the Creole term for any exhibition space (museum, gallery, etc.), while  Anmizé  means to have fun or to play. Mèt-an-Mizé  thus conveys multiple meanings: the master, the expert, the exhibition space, and the idea of playfulness. This title encapsulates what we aim to convey through this game: understanding artists' work and grasping the stakes of contemporary art in the Caribbean.
