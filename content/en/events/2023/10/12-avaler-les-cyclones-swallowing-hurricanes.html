    Avaler les cyclones (Swallowing hurricanes) Evariste Richer
  summary: >-
    <p>With « Avaler les cyclones », Evariste Richer offers La Criée a sensorial experience that unfolds in every dimension of the art centre’s space. Composed of works specially conceived for the occasion, the exhibition is an invitation to think about the ramified links between heaven and earth, history and myth, meteorology and the imaginary.</p>
  body: >-
    <p>About  <br>   <br>Avaler les cyclones  is a landscape in which we drift between <br> rainbow mountains, under a great fluorescent sun, along the borders of  <br>thunderstruck continents, caught up in the random turmoil of a sky  <br>composed of shades of grey. Avaler les cyclones  is a pseudomorphism **  in which <br> a circle becomes infinity, 75,000 faces of playing dice reveal the  <br>appearance of a hurricane and two helicopter blades become the hands of a <br> ghost clock. Avaler les cyclones  is a concatenation**** where the different works combine and wrap themselves into a spiral. Avaler les cyclone s is a climate that oscillates between disruption, lightning strike and bedazzlement. In  Avaler les cyclones  the human hand – that which holds the <br> conductor’s baton, the architect’s pencil, but also the blind man’s  <br>cane or the dice of chance – is always present. Through these suspended  <br>gestures and various operations, it attempts to reappropriate the  <br>experience of long time******. The exhibition questions man’s place on earth, his power of invention and his demiurgic excess. Avaler les cyclones  is an oxymoron: it speaks of suspension and acceleration, anxiety and wonder, movement and petrification. Avaler les cyclones  is a vertiginous experience that takes  <br>the form of a twilight haiku: human beings in the setting sun,  <br>spiralling out of control, the die is cast. With  Avaler les cyclones  Evariste Richer employs slow,  <br>intense, almost geological thought. This reflection crystallises in  <br>works that suspend, rush and interact to express the density and  <br>stratification of time as much as the irreducible intensity of the  <br>present. The exhibition is therefore a place where human, geological and  <br>cosmological history intertwine. In this respect, it is in keeping with  <br>the words of historian Achille Mbembe: « […] in dealing with the Earth,  <br>it is a symbiotic chain, in reality the extent of living beings and  <br>their innumerable manifestations, that we must keep in mind. Humans,  <br>animal, plant and mineral species, microbes, winds, tornadoes,  <br>hurricanes, bacteria and viruses, as well as the seas, skies, climate,  <br>technological systems and other artificial devices and externalities,  <br>are all inseparably part of it. And what about the soils and glaciers,  <br>the rocky mix deposited by the rivers, the striated hills, the clay, the <br> stone and the statues?  » ******** translation: Ken Peat <br>** – Phenomenon by which a mineral has the appearance of another mineral. **** – A series of terms, ideas, facts linked by causality. ****** – « One day, the space-time of the world will cease to <br> exist because we will have lost the extension and duration of the world <br> because of speed. Not only will we have saved time in getting from one  <br>point to another, but above all we will have lost the space-time of the  <br>world, because it will have become too small for the new technologies.  <br>There is a considerable symbolic loss here. », Conversation between Paul  <br>Virilio and Giairo Daghini, Dromologie : logique de la course, in  <br>Multitudes – futur antérieur 5 – printemps 91 ******** – Achille Mbembe, La communauté terrestre, La Découverte, Paris, 2023, p. 17.</p>  <p> Photography of the exhibition  <br>  </p>  <p>View of the exhibition  Avaler les cyclones  by Evariste Richer, La Criée centre d'art contemporain, Rennes, from 12 October to 23 December 2023</p>  <p>Evariste Richer,  Cyclone , 2023, 169 750 playing dice, 500 × 360 × 1,6 cm, view of the exhibition  Avaler les cyclones , La Criée centre d'art contemporain, Rennes, from 12 October to 23 December 2023</p>  <p>Evariste Richer,  Cyclone , 2023, 169 750 playing dice, 500 × 360 × 1,6 cm, view of the exhibition  Avaler les cyclones , La Criée centre d'art contemporain, Rennes, from 12 October to 23 December 2023</p>  <p>Evariste Richer,  Le monde foudroyé , 2023, watercolour on paper, 140 × 300 cm,  <br>view of the exhibition  Avaler les cyclones , La Criée centre d'art contemporain, Rennes, from 12 October to 23 December 2023</p>  <p>View of the exhibition  Avaler les cyclones  by Evariste Richer, La Criée centre d'art contemporain, Rennes, from 12 October to 23 December 2023</p>  <p>View of the exhibition  Avaler les cyclones  by Evariste Richer, La Criée centre d'art contemporain, Rennes, from 12 October to 23 December 2023</p>  <p>View of the exhibition  Avaler les cyclones  by Evariste Richer, La Criée centre d'art contemporain, Rennes, from 12 October to 23 December 2023</p>  <p>Evariste Richer,  Apocalypse , 2023, helicopter blade, orchestra baton, 510 × 40 × 10 cm, <br>view of the exhibition  Avaler les cyclones , La Criée centre d'art contemporain, Rennes, from 12 October to 23 December 2023</p>  <p>Evariste Richer,  Festina Lente , 2023, megaphone and ammonite, 40 × 24 × 30 cm, view of the exhibition  Avaler les cyclones , La Criée centre d'art contemporain, Rennes, from 12 October to 23 December 2023</p>  <p>View of the exhibition  Avaler les cyclones  by Evariste Richer, La Criée centre d'art contemporain, Rennes, from 12 October to 23 December 2023</p>  <p>Evariste Richer,  Histoire , 2023, helicopter blade, architect's pencil, 160 × 25 × 10 cm, <br>view of the exhibition  Avaler les cyclones , La Criée centre d'art contemporain, Rennes, from 12 October to 23 December 2023</p>  <p>Evariste Richer,  Cercle de Cues #5 , 2023, enamelled metal plates, 350 × 350 × 2 cm, <br>view of the exhibition  Avaler les cyclones , La Criée centre d'art contemporain, Rennes, from 12 October to 23 December 2023</p>  <p>View of the exhibition  Avaler les cyclones  by Evariste Richer, La Criée centre d'art contemporain, Rennes, from 12 October to 23 December 2023</p>  <p>Evariste Richer,  Le noyau du monde , 2019, Spherosiderite, Spokane, Washington ((USA)), Namacalathus Precambrian ((Namibia)), plaster cast, 10 × 22 ×28 cm, view of the exhibition  Avaler les cyclones , La Criée centre d'art contemporain, Rennes, from 12 October to 23 December 2023</p>  <p>Evariste Richer,  Les promesses , 2019, 13 photographs, colour silver prints, 10 × 15 cm each, <br>view of the exhibition  Avaler les cyclones , La Criée centre d'art contemporain, Rennes, from 12 October to 23 December 2023</p>  <p>Evariste Richer,  Les promesses , 2019,  <br>13 photographs, colour silver prints</p>  <p>, 10 × 15 cm each, <br>view of the exhibition  Avaler les cyclones , La Criée centre d'art contemporain, Rennes, from 12 October to 23 December 2023</p>  <p>Evariste Richer,  Métagrêle , 2019, plaster, playing dice, 30 × 15 × 8 cm,  <br>view of the exhibition  Avaler les cyclones , La Criée centre d'art contemporain, Rennes, from 12 October to 23 December 2023</p>  <p> Events  <br> Produced works  <br> Artist and curator  <br>  </p>  <p>Artiste</p>  <p>Commissaire</p>  <p> Documentation  <br>   <br>Dossier de presse "Avaler les cyclones", Evariste Richer </p>  <p>Communiqué de presse "Avaler les cyclones", Evariste Richer </p>  <p> Connections with the exhibition  </p>
