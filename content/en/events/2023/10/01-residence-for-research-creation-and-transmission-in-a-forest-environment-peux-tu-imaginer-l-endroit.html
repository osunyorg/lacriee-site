    Residence for research, creation and transmission in a forest environment : Peux-tu imaginer l’endroit dans lequel je vis et où pousse la forêt ? Léa Muller
  summary: >-
    <p>Over the past four years, Léa Muller has been cultivating her three plots in the Chalouzais forest. She plants, grows, cuts, lives, tests, observes, and combines the wild and the domestic.</p>
  body: >-
    <p>About  <br>   <br>The residency she will be running there throughout the 2023-2024  <br>season, at the invitation of La Criée, will enable her to invite other  <br>artists, researchers and experimenters, as well as neighbouring farmers  <br>and hunters, schoolchildren and students, to share their experiences and <br> thoughts on the subject of regeneration. This pooling of approaches and <br> viewpoints will contribute to building links and alliances between  <br>species, landscapes and practices. The question is: what constitutes art? A practice of observation? A  <br>practice of seeding and rooting? A practice of repairing and  <br>regeneration? <br>The residency of Léa Muller and her guests is part of Territoires EXTRA #7</p>  <p>  </p>  <p>Artiste, forestière et paysagiste</p>  <p> Connections with the residency  </p>
