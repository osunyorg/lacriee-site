    <p>About  <br>   <br>From this observation, I want children to adopt these forms to imagine a new architecture or landscape .  Line Simon <br> For these workshops, Line Simon has created ink stamps featuring the  <br>shapes of the exhibition's lights. Children can use them to first create <br> an "orderly" composition by assembling the shapes on the sheets until  <br>they are completely filled. They can observe the lines, curves, and  <br>proportions. In a second step, each child can create a landscape or  <br>architecture using the ink stamps.</p>  <p> Practical informations  <br>   <br>For 8 years old  childs with an adult free during : 1 h 30</p>  <p> Connections with the event  </p>
