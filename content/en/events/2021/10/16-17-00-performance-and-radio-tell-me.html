    Morgan Azaroff, Mathis Berchery, Émilien Chesnot, Charlotte Khouri & Anaïs Touchot, Guillaume Pellay, Francis Raynaud, Rubie and Alisson Schmitt Performance and radio event - TELL ME
  summary: >-
    <p>TELL ME is a performance and radio event. TELL ME seeks to reflect an art scene that combines pop culture and abstract forms.</p>
  body: >-
    <p>About  <br>   <br>TELL ME 2021 focuses on the emerging scene in Brittany. Program: soap opera, stress & objects, operators, unbearable songs, magic, weightlessness, stories & drinks, dreamy and ethereal R&B, computerized languages. TELL ME is a project of the Frac Bretagne, the Musée des beaux-arts de Rennes, La Criée center for contemporary art, and 40mcube with DUUU Radio. -- Guillaume Pellay <br> Temps des moissons au lieu des moissons <br> Performance <br> With Sarah Blumenfeld, Thomas Delahaye, Louis Deschamps, Guillaume Pellay, Solène Robert, and Lina Schlageter <br> As part of his exhibition  Blé  at 40mcube, Guillaume Pellay presents a performance centered around physical activity and the caloric expenditure necessary for energy storage. He combines comedy, ballads, realism, rock, and dance, redeploying the sources and elements of the exhibition: his geese, Catherine Ringer and Marcia, desire, the landscape view, or heat. <br> Location: 40mcube <br> Time: 3:00 PM <br> Duration: 45 minutes -- Morgan Azaroff <br> Enseignements secrets pour changer son corps et accéder à la veille ultime Performance <br> With Morgan Azaroff and Camille Le Pennec <br> "Before, I was stressed, and I communicated this stress to the objects and forms around me, giving them a living dimension. But for the past year, I have learned to develop and control my physical and spiritual resources. I now wonder if simply looking at and feeling the environment can invent forms." <br> Location: Musée des beaux-arts de Rennes <br> Time: 4:15 PM <br> Duration: 20 minutes <br> Video link </p>  <p> -- Francis Raynaud <br> Vertigo <br> Performance <br> Francis Raynaud presents a performance featuring actress Laure Catherin. This character, an aging illusionist and magician, borrows her story from texts by Claire Guezengar to Paul Auster, via Blaise Cendrars, telling us her disappointing story of levitation. <br>Written by Francis Raynaud, performed by Laure Catherin <br> Location: Musée des beaux-arts de Rennes <br> Time: 5:00 PM <br> Duration: 20 minutes -- Anaïs Touchot <br> Art, Fruits secs et linge de maison <br> Performance  "As a painter and portraitist, I have been practicing my craft in the parking lot of the Frac Bretagne for many years. Professional fairs, weddings, anniversaries, seminars, company committees, congresses, Christmas parties, municipal events, bar and bat mitzvahs, inaugurations, etc. My experience and expertise are at the service of your event's success. I also create caricatures, portraits, and silhouettes from photos. For more information: 02 99 37 37 93. Approximately 10 caricatures per hour. Student prices. The results can be spectacular but may sometimes be ineffective if met with cultural resistance." <br> Location: Frac Bretagne <br> Time: 6:00 PM – 10:00 PM <br> Duration: Continuous -- Emilien Chesnot <br> FENTANYL FLOWERS <br> Reading <br>Fentanyl flowers is an attempt to distance oneself from—and question—the computerized languages that surround us. It is an effort to see or do something with these masses of language without emitters or responses. <br> Location: Restaurant du Frac Bretagne <br> Time: 7:30 PM <br> Duration: 30 minutes -- Mathis Berchery <br> Me laisserez-vous <br> Performance  "I adopt the figure of a storyteller at the bar, letting myself be inhabited by collected voices and numerous stories. Each story—interviews, voicemails, film scenes, poems—has its place, its glass, and its shared drink. All contribute to a geography of thirst: vital necessity, tasting pleasure, reminiscence, excess, addiction, journey." <br> Location: Restaurant du Frac Bretagne <br> Time: 8:00 PM – 10:30 PM <br> Duration: Continuous -- Alisson Schmitt <br> Cette chanson que je ne supporte pas <br> Performance  <br>"There is this song I can't stand; it plays on my car radio, it plays in my mouth, so I grip the steering wheel tightly and accelerate." <br> Location: Frac Bretagne <br> Time: 9:00 PM <br> Duration: 20 minutes -- Rubie <br> The Next World <br> Concert <br> In a dream, a multi-voiced song marked by childhood and led by sound games where we seek the key to unsolved enigmas. <br> Location: Restaurant du Frac Bretagne <br> Time: 10:30 PM <br> Duration: 1 hour</p>  <p> Practical informations  <br>   <br>Partnerships -- Maison de la poésie – Rennes -- CREA Université Rennes 2 Support -- Ville de Rennes</p>  <p> Connections with the event  </p>

        <p>TELL ME 2021 focuses on the emerging scene in Brittany.</p><p>Program: soap opera, stress & objects, operators, unbearable songs, magic, weightlessness, stories & drinks, dreamy and ethereal R&B, computerized languages. TELL ME is a project of the Frac Bretagne, the Musée des beaux-arts de Rennes, La Criée center for contemporary art, and 40mcube with DUUU Radio.</p><p>-- Guillaume Pellay <br><i>Temps des moissons au lieu des moissons </i><br>Performance <br>With Sarah Blumenfeld, Thomas Delahaye, Louis Deschamps, Guillaume Pellay, Solène Robert, and Lina Schlageter <br>As part of his exhibition <i>Blé</i> at 40mcube, Guillaume Pellay presents a performance centered around physical activity and the caloric expenditure necessary for energy storage. He combines comedy, ballads, realism, rock, and dance, redeploying the sources and elements of the exhibition: his geese, Catherine Ringer and Marcia, desire, the landscape view, or heat. <br>Location: 40mcube <br>Time: 3:00 PM <br>Duration: 45 minutes</p><p>-- Morgan Azaroff <br><i>Enseignements secrets pour changer son corps et accéder à la veille ultime</i><br>Performance <br>With Morgan Azaroff and Camille Le Pennec <br>"Before, I was stressed, and I communicated this stress to the objects and forms around me, giving them a living dimension. But for the past year, I have learned to develop and control my physical and spiritual resources. I now wonder if simply looking at and feeling the environment can invent forms." <br>Location: Musée des beaux-arts de Rennes <br>Time: 4:15 PM <br>Duration: 20 minutes </p><p>Video link</p><p>  </p><p>-- Francis Raynaud <br><i>Vertigo </i><br>Performance <br>Francis Raynaud presents a performance featuring actress Laure Catherin. This character, an aging illusionist and magician, borrows her story from texts by Claire Guezengar to Paul Auster, via Blaise Cendrars, telling us her disappointing story of levitation. Written by Francis Raynaud, performed by Laure Catherin <br>Location: Musée des beaux-arts de Rennes <br>Time: 5:00 PM <br>Duration: 20 minutes</p><p>-- Anaïs Touchot <br><i>Art, Fruits secs et linge de maison </i><br>Performance <br>"As a painter and portraitist, I have been practicing my craft in the parking lot of the Frac Bretagne for many years. Professional fairs, weddings, anniversaries, seminars, company committees, congresses, Christmas parties, municipal events, bar and bat mitzvahs, inaugurations, etc. My experience and expertise are at the service of your event's success. I also create caricatures, portraits, and silhouettes from photos. For more information: 02 99 37 37 93. Approximately 10 caricatures per hour. Student prices. The results can be spectacular but may sometimes be ineffective if met with cultural resistance." <br>Location: Frac Bretagne <br>Time: 6:00 PM – 10:00 PM <br>Duration: Continuous</p><p>-- Emilien Chesnot <br><i>FENTANYL FLOWERS </i><br>Reading Fentanyl flowers is an attempt to distance oneself from—and question—the computerized languages that surround us. It is an effort to see or do something with these masses of language without emitters or responses. <br>Location: Restaurant du Frac Bretagne <br>Time: 7:30 PM <br>Duration: 30 minutes</p><p>-- Mathis Berchery <br><i>Me laisserez-vous </i><br>Performance <br>"I adopt the figure of a storyteller at the bar, letting myself be inhabited by collected voices and numerous stories. Each story—interviews, voicemails, film scenes, poems—has its place, its glass, and its shared drink. All contribute to a geography of thirst: vital necessity, tasting pleasure, reminiscence, excess, addiction, journey." <br>Location: Restaurant du Frac Bretagne <br>Time: 8:00 PM – 10:30 PM <br>Duration: Continuous</p><p>-- Alisson Schmitt <br><i>Cette chanson que je ne supporte pas </i><br>Performance<br> "There is this song I can't stand; it plays on my car radio, it plays in my mouth, so I grip the steering wheel tightly and accelerate." <br>Location: Frac Bretagne <br>Time: 9:00 PM <br>Duration: 20 minutes</p><p>-- Rubie <br><i>The Next World </i><br>Concert <br>In a dream, a multi-voiced song marked by childhood and led by sound games where we seek the key to unsolved enigmas. <br>Location: Restaurant du Frac Bretagne <br>Time: 10:30 PM <br>Duration: 1 hour</p>
