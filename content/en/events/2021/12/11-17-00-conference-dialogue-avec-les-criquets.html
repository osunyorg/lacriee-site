    <p>About  <br>   <br>During the event, researcher and agronomist Marc Dufumier will converse  <br>with the locusts living in the exhibition, and will question current  <br>agricultural models by discussing alternatives. Orane Bert and Adrien  <br>Aras of the cooperative brickworks TERRE, an Emmaüs community, will join <br> the round table to introduce the volunteer community project that  <br>contributed to the manufacture of many of the bricks in the exhibition  <br>and about their work on economic, ecological and social alternatives.</p>  <p> Practical informations  <br>   <br>-- Marc Dufumier is an agronomist and honorary professor of comparative agriculture and agricultural development at AgroParisTech (Institute of Life and Environmental Sciences and Technologies), where he taught for over thirty years. He has also conducted research in environmental and developmental fields at the Institute for Research and Application of Development Methods. These activities have led him to undertake numerous missions in Latin America, Africa, Asia, etc. He is currently a member of the scientific council of the Foundation for Nature and Mankind. <br>As a new Emmaüs community, the TERRE association is launching a Solidarity Brickworks in the Rennes countryside. The aim is to provide a place of welcome, support, and communal living for homeless individuals, accompanied by an economic activity of producing raw earth construction materials. The goal is to create a viable, solidarity-based economic model founded on social diversity.-- Orane Bert is the project leader and the current mission coordinator for the association. Initially trained in nature conservation, she then worked to secure the rights of marginalized individuals while discovering raw earth masonry. <br>-- Adrien Aras is the co-president of the association. An architect by training, he later specialized in the renovation of historic buildings and raw earth masonry. He is currently active in several Breton and Champagne associations.</p>  <p> Connections with the event  </p>

        <p>During the event, researcher and agronomist Marc Dufumier will converse  with the locusts living in the exhibition, and will question current  agricultural models by discussing alternatives. Orane Bert and Adrien  Aras of the cooperative brickworks TERRE, an Emmaüs community, will join  the round table to introduce the volunteer community project that  contributed to the manufacture of many of the bricks in the exhibition  and about their work on economic, ecological and social alternatives.</p>
