    <p>About  <br>   <br>Elvia Teotski’s exhibition restores the term’s status, in the same  <br>spirit as her broader recycling of decommissioned and discarded  <br>materials. Welcoming the public into an inhabited space marked by  <br>constant yet barely perceptible movements, she invites them to roam  <br>attentively through an environment where different organic components  <br>co-evolve. Conceived as a non-spectacular entity in its own right, the  <br>exhibition calls on visitors to take their time, to savour the minimal  <br>odours and movements that testify to the presence of other living beings <br> and functioning biological processes. Molusma  takes as its starting point the artist’s extensive  <br>research along the Breton, Marseille and Mexican coasts, and her  <br>simultaneous interweaving and questioning of their territorial  <br>relationships. A trained agronomist, she focuses on the shifting space  <br>where interdependent forms of life accumulate and human societies leave  <br>their mark. Drawing on patient observation of environments on the  <br>fringes of agricultural and marine production zones in Brittany, she has <br> collected samples and consulted with activists, historic building  <br>experts and scientists. Whence her fine-tuned experiments, rooted in  <br>experience of the territory and its multiple inhabitants. Coming to terms with materials which, altered by human activity,  <br>exceed their users’ initial intentions and generate entropic processes,  <br>Elvia Teotski explores what anthropologist Anna Tsing calls a ‘feral  <br>ecology’: an environment made up of domesticated creatures whose  <br>evolution defies human control. The artist engages with these unstable  <br>configurations, in which life forms emerge from the destruction  <br>triggered by productivism’s promise of ever-increasing yields. She  <br>occupies the tipping points, where new forms of existence emerge in  <br>affected environments and give rise to creative speculation. The exhibition presents adobe constructions whose « mud bricks » are  <br>produced in collaboration with the solidary brick factory T.E.R.R.E.,  <br>using earth recovered from building sites and seaweed washed up on the  <br>coast. Assembled into building components, the evolving bricks absorb  <br>ambient humidity and become carriers of mould, or shrink as they dry,  <br>altering their balance. Insects nest in the interstices of the buildings <br> and in turn become part of a food cycle: while they are fed off the  <br>remains of the nearby market, they are themselves potential food for  <br>humans. At a time when intensive livestock farming and its drastic  <br>consequences for animals, the soil and the marine environment are coming <br> under increasing fire in Brittany and elsewhere,  Molusma   <br>regulates a fragile set of interdependent organisms, which require  <br>constant attention to their habitat. It invites the public to enter the « sensitive zone », tune in and take care.
