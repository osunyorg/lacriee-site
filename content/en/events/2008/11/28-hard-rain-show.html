    Hard Rain Show Ângela Ferreira
  summary: >-
    <p> Born in Maputo, Mozambique, in 1958, Ângela Ferreira has lived in  Portugal and South Africa, where she developed an acute sensivity to the  geopolitical issues that form the starting point of her work.  </p>
  body: >-
    <p>About  <br>   <br>Over the last twenty years Ângela Ferreira has  <br>created an extensive oeuvre in which she interrogates geo-political, art <br> historical and gender issues related to given cultural contexts through <br> a range of different media. Her installations frequently include  <br>sculptures that evoke modernist practices, combined with  <br>semi-documentary photographic and video material. Formulating questions  <br>about notions of perspective, her work opens up spaces between the  <br>political and the aesthetical.</p>  <p>Her first solo exhibition in France is an opportunity for the French  <br>audience to engage with Ferreira's body of work. The complex  <br>relationships between Europe and Africa are interrogated using the back  <br>and forth of modernism and its complicity with colonialism and its  <br>utopian promise of a better future. <br>On show at La Criée is  Maison Tropicale  created in 2007 for the Venice Biennale.  <br>A series of photographs and a large-scale wooden and metal sculpture are <br> inspired by the history of a failed modernist housing project by the  <br>(now famous) French designer Jean Prouvé. What was conceived as a mass  <br>housing project for Africa resulted between 1949 and 1951 in only three  <br>prototypes of a Tropical House sent from France to its colonies: to  <br>Niamey in Niger and to Brazzaville in Congo. The 'rediscovery' of  <br>Prouvé's design in the 1990s led to the dismantling of all three of them <br> a few years ago, and for them to be brought back to Europe for  <br>restoration. They have subsequently been usurped by the current design  <br>and art market.  <br>In Ferreira's  Maison Tropicale  the artist presents photographs of <br> the remains of the houses in Africa, of those parts that were not  <br>considered worth being commercialised. The artist combines them with a  <br>structure filled with sculptural elements derived from Prouvé's Tropical <br> House designs, transforming them, as curator Jürgen Bock has called it, <br> into 'permanently adrift containers of history'. <br>Two other works are being presented at the Art School in Rennes : <br>In  For Mozambique (Model N°2 of a Screen-Orator-Kiosk celebrating a post-Independence Utopia),  <br> In For Mozambique (Model No. 2 of a Screen- Orator-Kiosk celebrating a  <br>post- independence Utopia) Ângela Ferreira created a specific  <br>perspective on the historical momentum of the recently independent  <br>country of Mozambique in 1975, linking it in her installation to the  <br>history of the modernist utopia of Russian constructivism. Agitprop  <br>artist Gustav Klucis's search for a unity between art and the social and <br> political in the 1920s becomes, through Ferreira's evocation of his  <br>kiosks, the theoretical and physical base of her installation. Video  <br>excerpts of footage of a Bob Dylan concert and a Jean Rouch film, both  <br>celebrating the post-independence utopia of a recently-born nation, are  <br>projected onto it. <br> Zip Zap Circus School  comprises three wooden and canvas  <br>modules, proposing an imaginary space between European and African  <br>discourses on architecture. Two never built projects are connected in  <br>the installation: a Mies van der Rohe 1913 villa with the modernist  <br>architect's technique of 'rehearsing' it through wooden and canvas  <br>structures that could be moved around on its future site in a park in  <br>Holland. The other is a project by the Mozambican architect Pancho  <br>Guedes, for a South African Community project for a Circus School in  <br>Cape Town, designed in the 1990s</p>  <p> partnerships </p>  <p>Berardo Collection Museum, Lisbonne <br>https://www.ccb.pt/macccb/</p>  <p>Maumaus School of Visual Arts, Lisbon <br>https://maumaus.org/</p>  <p>Institut Camões, Portugal <br>https://www.instituto-camoes.pt/en/</p>  <p>  </p>  <p>collaboration with Rennes Regional School of Fine Arts as part of the European cultural season in France (1 July-31 December 2008)</p>  <p> Photos de l’exposition  <br>  </p>  <p>                     Ângela Ferreira,  Zip Zap Circus School , École des beaux-arts de Rennes, 2000 – 2002  <br>vue de l’exposition  Hard Rain Show , La Criée centre d’art contemporain et l’École des beaux-arts de Rennes, 2009 © Benoît Mauras  <br>            </p>  <p>                     Ângela Ferreira,  Zip Zap Circus School , École des beaux-arts de Rennes, 2000 – 2002 vue de l’exposition  Hard Rain Show , La Criée centre d’art contemporain et l’École des beaux-arts de Rennes, 2009 © Benoît Mauras</p>  <p>                     Ângela Ferreira,  Maison Tropicale , La Criée centre d’art contemporain, Rennes, 2009 vue de l’exposition  Hard Rain Show , La Criée centre d’art contemporain et l’École des beaux-arts de Rennes, 2009 © Benoît Mauras  <br>            </p>  <p>Ângela Ferreira,  Maison Tropicale , La Criée centre d’art contemporain, Rennes, 2009 vue de l’exposition  Hard Rain Show , La Criée centre d’art contemporain et l’École des beaux-arts de Rennes, 2009 © Benoît Mauras</p>  <p>Ângela Ferreira,  Maison Tropicale , La Criée centre d’art contemporain, Rennes, 2009 vue de l’exposition  Hard Rain Show , La Criée centre d’art contemporain et l’École des beaux-arts de Rennes, 2009 © Benoît Mauras</p>  <p>                     Ângela Ferreira,  For Mozambique (Model n°2) , École des beaux-arts de Rennes, 2009 vue de l’exposition  Hard Rain Show , La Criée centre d’art contemporain et l’École des beaux-arts de Rennes, 2009 © Benoît Mauras  <br>            </p>  <p>Ângela Ferreira,  For Mozambique (Model n°2) , École des beaux-arts de Rennes, 2009 vue de l’exposition  Hard Rain Show , La Criée centre d’art contemporain et l’École des beaux-arts de Rennes, 2009 © Benoît Mauras</p>  <p> Œuvres produites  <br> Artiste et commissaire de l’exposition  <br> Connections with the exhibition  </p>

        <p> Over the last twenty years Ângela Ferreira has  created an extensive oeuvre in which she interrogates geo-political, art  historical and gender issues related to given cultural contexts through  a range of different media. Her installations frequently include  sculptures that evoke modernist practices, combined with  semi-documentary photographic and video material. Formulating questions  about notions of perspective, her work opens up spaces between the  political and the aesthetical.  Her first solo exhibition in France is an opportunity for the French  audience to engage with Ferreira's body of work. The complex  relationships between Europe and Africa are interrogated using the back  and forth of modernism and its complicity with colonialism and its  utopian promise of a better future. On show at La Criée is <i>Maison Tropicale</i> created in 2007 for the Venice Biennale.<br> A series of photographs and a large-scale wooden and metal sculpture are  inspired by the history of a failed modernist housing project by the  (now famous) French designer Jean Prouvé. What was conceived as a mass  housing project for Africa resulted between 1949 and 1951 in only three  prototypes of a Tropical House sent from France to its colonies: to  Niamey in Niger and to Brazzaville in Congo. The 'rediscovery' of  Prouvé's design in the 1990s led to the dismantling of all three of them  a few years ago, and for them to be brought back to Europe for  restoration. They have subsequently been usurped by the current design  and art market.<br> In Ferreira's <i>Maison Tropicale</i> the artist presents photographs of  the remains of the houses in Africa, of those parts that were not  considered worth being commercialised. The artist combines them with a  structure filled with sculptural elements derived from Prouvé's Tropical  House designs, transforming them, as curator Jürgen Bock has called it,  into 'permanently adrift containers of history'. Two other works are being presented at the Art School in Rennes : In <i>For Mozambique (Model N°2 of a Screen-Orator-Kiosk celebrating a post-Independence Utopia),</i>  In For Mozambique (Model No. 2 of a Screen- Orator-Kiosk celebrating a  post- independence Utopia) Ângela Ferreira created a specific  perspective on the historical momentum of the recently independent  country of Mozambique in 1975, linking it in her installation to the  history of the modernist utopia of Russian constructivism. Agitprop  artist Gustav Klucis's search for a unity between art and the social and  political in the 1920s becomes, through Ferreira's evocation of his  kiosks, the theoretical and physical base of her installation. Video  excerpts of footage of a Bob Dylan concert and a Jean Rouch film, both  celebrating the post-independence utopia of a recently-born nation, are  projected onto it. <i>Zip Zap Circus School</i> comprises three wooden and canvas  modules, proposing an imaginary space between European and African  discourses on architecture.
