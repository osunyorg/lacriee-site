    <p>About  <br>   <br>In echo with these two exhibitions, and to conclude this highlight  <br>in a festive manner, these Rennes institutions are coming together to  <br>offer an evening centered around raï music at La Grande Scène de  <br>l’Antipode. Katia Kameli presents  Mon Anthologie du raï , a performance  <br>aimed at immersing the audience in a sensory encounter with raï music.  <br>To complement the evening, she invites Sofiane Saidi for a solo live  <br>performance and Acid Arab for a DJ set to ignite the dance floor. Mon anthologie du raï by Katia Kameli – Performance With Sofiane Saidi and Faiza Lellou A proposal by Katia Kameli aimed at immersing the audience in a sensory  <br>encounter with raï music  –  a popular music genre meaning "opinion,  <br>freedom" in Arabic  –  using listening as an open process to navigate  <br>through the genre's history and explore its rebellious contributions to  <br>Algeria's history. Reflecting Algerian culture through its musical and  <br>textual creolization, raï serves as a substitute for the lack of  <br>exchanges between men, women, and generations, allowing us to consider  <br>the social and cultural changes Algeria is experiencing today. For this  <br>session, she invites Sofiane Saidi and Faiza Lellou to join her in  <br>rewinding iconic cassettes. Sofiane Saidi – Live – Électro – Raï The prince of raï 2.0! Raised in Algeria and having arrived in Paris 30  <br>years ago, Sofiane Saidi continues to explore new bridges between  <br>Oriental roots and grooves from around the world. His latest project,  <br>developed in 2021 during his residency at La Dynamo, is called Wahdi,  <br>which means 'all alone' in Arabic. It promises, in live performances, "an experience of the night, a subversive exploration, a charge of  <br>erotic transgression, the soul of raï in an electronic body."  Acid Arab – Dj set – Électro – Musiques du monde With their irresistible blend of powerful electronic music and Arab and  <br>Middle Eastern sounds, Acid Arab has patiently refined their style and  <br>set stages alight. Following the success of their first two albums,  <br> Musique de France  in 2016 and Jdiden in 2019, Acid Arab's new album is  <br>expected in October 2022.</p>  <p> Practical informations  <br>   <br>as part of Pas sommeil  exhibition and Exporama partnership     Frac Bretagne     Les Champs Libres     Musée des beaux-arts de Rennes   L’Antipode Parvis Agnès Varda 75 avenue Jules Maniez 35000 Rennes plus d’informations Ouverture des portes : 20h00 Début des concerts : 20h30 Antipode – La Grande Scène Placement libre assis-debout Entrée libre dans la limite des places disponibles.</p>  <p> Connections with the event  </p>

        <p>In echo with these two exhibitions, and to conclude this highlight  in a festive manner, these Rennes institutions are coming together to  offer an evening centered around raï music at La Grande Scène de  l’Antipode. Katia Kameli presents <i>Mon Anthologie du raï</i>, a performance  aimed at immersing the audience in a sensory encounter with raï music.  To complement the evening, she invites Sofiane Saidi for a solo live  performance and Acid Arab for a DJ set to ignite the dance floor.</p><p><br><b>Mon anthologie du raï by Katia Kameli – Performance</b><br><i>With Sofiane Saidi and Faiza Lellou</i></p><p><i><br></i>A proposal by Katia Kameli aimed at immersing the audience in a sensory  encounter with raï music <b>–</b> a popular music genre meaning "opinion,  freedom" in Arabic<b> –</b> using listening as an open process to navigate  through the genre's history and explore its rebellious contributions to  Algeria's history. Reflecting Algerian culture through its musical and  textual creolization, raï serves as a substitute for the lack of  exchanges between men, women, and generations, allowing us to consider  the social and cultural changes Algeria is experiencing today. For this  session, she invites Sofiane Saidi and Faiza Lellou to join her in  rewinding iconic cassettes.</p><p><br><b>Sofiane Saidi – Live – Électro – Raï</b></p><p><b><br></b>The prince of raï 2.0! Raised in Algeria and having arrived in Paris 30  years ago, Sofiane Saidi continues to explore new bridges between  Oriental roots and grooves from around the world. His latest project,  developed in 2021 during his residency at La Dynamo, is called Wahdi,  which means 'all alone' in Arabic. It promises, in live performances, "an experience of the night, a subversive exploration, a charge of  erotic transgression, the soul of raï in an electronic body."</p><p><br><b> Acid Arab – Dj set – Électro – Musiques du monde</b></p><p><b><br></b>With their irresistible blend of powerful electronic music and Arab and  Middle Eastern sounds, Acid Arab has patiently refined their style and  set stages alight. Following the success of their first two albums,  <i>Musique de France</i> in 2016 and Jdiden in 2019, Acid Arab's new album is  expected in October 2022.</p>
