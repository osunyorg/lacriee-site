  summary: >-
    <p>Imagine that this communiqué is being joyfully bellowed out over a slightly crackling megaphone attached to the top of a van that has been customised with the colours of the art centre and a rainbow** ; it is driving slowly through the streets of Rennes, trying to drum up business.</p>

    <p>About  <br>   <br>Listen up dear people of Rennes and of France: come and discover  DARK-EN-CIEL , <br> the new exhibition in full Technicolor by Bertille Bak, a formidable  <br>young artist, whose talent is being celebrated around the world!**** Colourful shows for the kids, 3D animations made with <br> trickery and obvious subterfuges, actual sets out created from  <br>cardboard, circular and rectangular films, new works filled with  <br>frightening surprises and more.  <br>Don’t miss Bertille Bak’s  DARK-EN-CIEL : an exhibition that rolls over for you, takes you to the stars, cries foul, seesaws, and twists and twists again. That’s  DARK-EN-CIEL , 22 January until 24 April 2022 at La Criée, contemporary art centre and old fish market! A conversation between two (very well-informed) shoppers after the van passes by:  <br>– Bertille Bak … isn’t she that artist who’s interested in communities – <br> often marginal, fragile or invisible – with whom she builds fictions,  <br>politically engaged and a little bit odd?  <br>– Yes, that’s her. She started in the coalmines, in Barlin, on her  <br>grandmother’s housing estate, then she worked with the Roma in  <br>Ivry­‑sur‑Seine, nuns in Paris, maritime workers in Saint‑Nazaire, and  <br>further away, residents of a Bangkok neighbourhood being threatened with <br> eviction, shrimp shellers in Morocco and suchlike.  <br>– She seems to be making her way using the world’s miseries don’t you think? And what’s she showing in La Criée?  <br>– She’s continuing to mine the exploitation vein. She’s showing a new  <br>project, Mineur Mineur, that she’s been working on for three years,  <br>about child labour in mines, and two other recent projects: Bleus de  <br>travail, in which she plays with birds, and La Brigada, filmed in La Paz <br> in Bolivia, where she focused her lens on the city’s shoeshine boys.  <br>– I see: so her films and installations sit at the tipping point between <br> utopia and exploitation, enchantment and irony, reality and fiction, a  <br>taste for the absurd and a DIY spirit.  <br>– That’s right, there’s a subversive, playful streak in Bertille Bak’s  <br>work, a kind of resistance, and I find a hint of Belgian humour, a dash  <br>of Wallace & Gromit, and a pinch Fischli & Weiss.  <br>– Okay, now you’re just throwing names at me. Let’s go have a drink, just to get ourselves ready to see the exhibition … <br>** The exhibition’s title is a play on the French word for rainbow,  arc-en-cie l . **** Bertille Bak has a number of solo exhibitions  <br>scheduled for 2022: at the Fondation Mario Merz in Turin, at the  <br>Louvre-Lens, and in Rennes at La Criée centre d’art contemporain and  <br>Galerie Art&Essai.</p>  <p> Photography of the exhibition  <br>  </p>  <p>Photo, Aurélien Mole <br>Bertille Bak,  Mineur Mineur , 2022 ,  five simultaneous videos, colour, sound, 14 min stage, metal structure, monitors, wall paint, 200 cm × 500 cm × 233 cm, <br>view of the exhibition  Dark-en-ciel , La Criée centre d'art contemporain, Rennes, from 22 January to 24 April 2022 </p>  <p>Photo, Aurélien Mole <br>View of the exhibition  Dark-en-ciel  by Bertille Bak, La Criée centre d'art contemporain, Rennes, from 22 January to 24 April 2022 </p>  <p>Photo, Aurélien Mole</p>  <p>Bertille Bak,  This mine is mine , 2022 ,  three structures made of metal, cardboard and luminous wires, 120 cm × 56 cm × 200 cm each,   view of the exhibition  Dark-en-ciel , La Criée centre d'art contemporain, Rennes, from 22 January to 24 April 2022 </p>  <p>Photo, Aurélien Mole <br>Bertille Bak,  La Brigada , 2018-2022 ,  video, colour, sound, 12 min 28 sec screen, metal structure, 24 shoe-shine boxes collected in La Paz, Bolivia, variable dimensions,   view of the exhibition  Dark-en-ciel , La Criée  <br>centre d'art contemporain, Rennes, from 22 January to 24 April 2022, production : La Criée centre d'art contemporain and the French Embassy in Bolivi </p>  <p>Photo, Aurélien Mole <br>Bertille Bak,  La Brigada  ((détail)) , 2018-2022 ,  video, colour, sound, 12 min 28 sec, screen, metal structure, 24 shoe-shine boxes collected in La Paz, Bolivia, variable dimensions, <br>view of the exhibition  Dark-en-ciel , La Criée  <br>centre d'art contemporain, Rennes, from 22 January to 24 April 2022, production : La Criée centre d'art contemporain and the French Embassy in Bolivi </p>  <p>Photo, Aurélien Mole <br>Bertille Bak,  Bleus de travail , 2019, video, colour, sound, 9 min 55 sec, lampshades, bulbs, view of the exhibition  Dark-en-ciel , La Criée centre d'art contemporain, Rennes, from 22 January to 24 April 2022,  production : Le Cyclop, Milly-la-Forêt </p>  <p> Events  <br> Produced works  <br> Artist and curator  <br>  </p>  <p>Artiste</p>  <p>Commissaire</p>  <p> Documentation  <br>   <br>Dossier de presse "Dark-en-ciel", Bertille Bak</p>  <p>Communiqué de presse "Dark-en-ciel", Bertille Bak</p>  <p> Connections with the exhibition  </p>
