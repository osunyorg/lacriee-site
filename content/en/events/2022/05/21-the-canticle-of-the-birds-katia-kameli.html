    Le Cantique des oiseaux (The Canticle of the Birds) Katia Kameli
  summary: >-
    <p>From 21 May to 28 August 2022, La Criée centre for contemporary Art is presenting « Le Cantique des oiseaux » (The Canticle of the Birds), a choral exhibition and new production by Katia Kameli, in which the artist proposes a variation, composed of musical ceramics, watercolours and a film, on the famous text of the same name by the Persian poet Farîd-ud-Dîn ‘Attâr. With Le Cantique des oiseaux, Katia Kameli continues her inter-cultural journeyings and initiates direct contact with clay, a new material for her.</p>
  body: >-
    <p>About  <br>   <br>Attâr’s text (1174=1248) sings of the journey of thousands of birds  <br>in search of the fabled bird Simorgh, a central figure of Persian  <br>mythology. This symbolic spiritual journey of initiation takes them  <br>through the seven successive valleys of Desire, Love, Knowledge,  <br>Plenitude, Oneness, Perplexity, Denial and Annihilation. Guided by the  <br>hoopoe, symbol of wisdom, only thirty birds reach the end of the  <br>journey. Kameli gradually became interested in this major Eastern text through <br> French translations: firstly that of Henri Gougaud, then that of  <br>Jean-Claude Carrière and finally the recent one by Leili Anvar, from  <br>which she has borrowed her title. With this reworking** of Attâr’s text, the artist continues her  <br>exploration of the narratives, their successive translations, their flow <br> and their  evolving  depth and multiplicity of meaning. She is also interested in the spiritual dimension of Attâr’s story,  <br>in the inner quest that unfolds through the figure of the bird, an  <br>animal that links the earth to the sky and whose language we find both  <br>so familiar and so mysterious. Kameli’s translation of the  The Canticle of the Birds  is  <br>sensual and multi-sensory. It is expressed in a series of ceramics,  <br>which take the form of some of the birds in the poem: the hoopoe, the  <br>peacock, the nightingale, the heron, etc. These sculptures are also  <br>musical instruments. Their singing can be heard in the accompanying  <br>film, activated by a procession of musicians, as well as in the  <br>performances, which set the exhibition space resonating. Watercolours, some of which served as preparatory drawings for the  <br>ceramics, complete this allegretto. Their inspirations are multiple,  <br>from Persian miniatures to Minoan sculptures, via Valentine Schlegel and <br> Asger Jorn. Made on paper of different sizes, some are surrounded by  <br>clay frames; they are at the crossroads of scholarly and popular art.  <br>Like the sculptures, they have to do with the birth and memory of  <br>gesture. With  Le Cantique des oiseaux , Kameli proposes a new  <br>experience of translation – from one work to another, from one art form  <br>to another, from one medium to another, from the inexpressible to the  <br>visible – resulting in both gaps and interminglings. « We don’t invent anything, we always reinterpret in another language. » — Katia Kameli <br>** – The term ‘reworking’ is used by Omar Berrada in his essay on  Stream of Stories . He himself takes this term from Valentin Y. Mudimbe ( The Invention of Africa ) and writes “It is a question of exhuming a story, of remembering it, but also of re-articulating it”, in  Katia Kameli  (Paris: Manuella Editions, 2021), p. 105</p>  <p> Photography of the exhibition  <br>  </p>  <p>Vue de l'exposition  Le Quantique des oiseaux  de Katia Kameli, La Criée centre d'art contemporain, Rennes, du 21 mai 28 août 2022 © Marc Domage </p>  <p>Vue de l'exposition  Le Quantique des oiseaux  de Katia Kameli, La Criée centre d'art contemporain, Rennes, du 21 mai 28 août 2022 © Marc Domage</p>  <p>Katia Kameli,  Dessins préparatoires , 2022, 14 aquarelles sur papier, cadres et aimants en céramique, 1 dessin en poussière de terre, vue de l'exposition  Le Quantique des oiseaux , du 21 mai 28 août 2022, production : La Criée centre d'art contemporain © Marc Domage</p>  <p>Katia Kameli,  Le rossignol , 2022, céramiques musicales en grès chamotté sur socle, vue de l'exposition  Le Quantique des oiseaux , du 21 mai 28 août 2022, production : La Criée centre d'art contemporain © Marc Domage</p>  <p>Katia Kameli,  Le Paon , 2022, céramiques musicales en grès chamotté sur socle, vue de l'exposition  Le Quantique des oiseaux , du 21 mai 28 août 2022, production : La Criée centre d'art contemporain © Marc Domage</p>  <p> Events  <br> Produced artworks  <br> Artist and curator  <br>  </p>  <p>Artiste</p>  <p>Commissaire</p>  <p> Documentation  <br>   <br>Dossier de presse "Le cantique des oiseaux", Katia Kameli</p>  <p>Communiqué de presse "Le cantique des oiseaux", Katia Kameli</p>  <p> Connections with the exhibition  </p>
