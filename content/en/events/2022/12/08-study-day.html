    Study day History and current status of artist-run spaces in Brittany
  summary: >-
    <p> The dual circumstances of Brittany's growing attractiveness and the questioning of Paris as an obligatory artistic passage have led to the recent creation of numerous self-managed artist spaces and collectives in Brittany. This study day aims to examine this phenomenon, its history and current state in Brittany's territory, in relation to national and international experiences.  </p>
  body: >-
    <p>About  <br>   <br>In what local, national, and international histories are they situated? What needs and aspirations - artistic, economic, professional, etc. - do they address? How do they operate? What connections are formed with the territory where they settle? What effects - artistic, economic, symbolic, sociological - can be observed? Is the term "artist-run space" adequate and does it reflect the reality of artist-managed spaces today?During this study day, the morning contributions will establish the historical and theoretical framework of these spaces through examples from the United States, Europe, and France, from the 1960s to present. The afternoon presentations will showcase three Breton ventures, echoed by examples from le Grand Paris (Paris and its nearest surrounding suburbs) and the Netherlands. All presentations will be followed by discussions between guests and the audience to encourage questions and experience sharing.PROGRAM <br>9:30 AM-12:30 PM <br>Historical and theoretical issues of self-managed spaces since the 1960s <br>-- Pauline Chevalier, art historian, associate professor at University of Bourgogne – Franche-Comté, INHA advisor <br>-- Gallien Déjean, art critic, curator and co-founder of Treize <br>-- Alun Williams, artist, founder of Triangle, Parker's Box and Minoterie 21 Round table moderated by Émeline Jaret, art historian, teacher-researcher at Rennes 2 University.2:30 PM-5:00 PM <br>Comparative history of Breton self-managed spaces and current issues <br>-- Vincent Victor Jouffe, artist, former member of Site expérimental de pratiques artistiques (Le Bon Accueil), Rennes <br>-- Mathilde Vaillant, artist and doctoral student, member of Vivarium, Rennes <br>-- Joachim Monvoisin, artist and co-founder of SUPRA, Saint-Aubin des Landes <br>-- Albine Bessire, Wonder coordinator and Charlotte Janis, artist co-founder of Wonder, various locations, le Grand Paris <br>-- Joséphine Kaeppelin, artist and member of Grey Light Project, Heerlen, Netherlands <br>Round table moderated by Sophie Kaplan, director of La Criée centre d'art contemporain <br>Territoires EXTRA has been developing since 2017, initiated by art centers Passerelle in Brest and La Criée in Rennes.
