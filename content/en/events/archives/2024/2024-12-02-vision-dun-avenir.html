        <p><i>Vision for a future </i>Present <i>Madurai</i>, a work emblematic of the work of Pierre Jean Giloux. This film in augmented reality invites us to consider a near future, in cities marked by the climate emergency. How to reinvent the city through nature and science so that it remains habitable and liveable? Through his research and achievements, Pierre Jean Giloux is at the crossroads of documentary and science fiction and anticipates the development of new links between architecture, technology and biology. </p>
