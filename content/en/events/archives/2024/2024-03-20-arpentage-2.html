        <p>To coincide with Anne-Charlotte Finel's exhibition <i>Respiro </i>, we invite you to take another look at the book <em>Dans l'œil du crocodile</em> by Val Plumwood<em>.</em><br></p><p>In February 1985, the environmental philosopher Val Plumwood survived - against all the odds - a crocodile attack in Australia's Kakadu National Park.<br></p><p>In Plumwood's eyes, inspired as she was by the mythological tales of the Australian Aborigines and the ancient Egyptians, the crocodile is a <em>trickster</em>, a creature that harshly judges human beings' pretence to extricate themselves from the cycle of life.<br></p><p>Unfinished at the time of the author's death, this story is supplemented by four essays on our relationship with living things: on the death of a wombat, on vegan ontology, on the film <em>Babe: the pig who became a shepherd</em>, and on life in our cemeteries.<br></p><p><em>Dans l'œil du crocodile</em> is not just a tale of survival, it's also a unique reflection on the meaning of our human lives, our struggles and our deaths.<br></p><p>A great life lesson about vulnerability and living together.
