    L’urgence de la lenteur (The urgency of slowness) Study days
  summary: >-
    <p>On the occasion of the study days entitled « L'urgence de la lenteur » (« The Urgency of Slowness »), organised by Atelier Vivant ((EESAB - EUR CAPS)), a research and visual arts workshop exploring transformations in our relationship with the living world, students from EESAB-site Rennes and EESAB-site Quimper, ESAD Valence, La Criée and Institut Agro are getting together for a meeting on the theme of slowness.</p>

    About <br><br> <br>The urgency of slowness... This seemingly contradictory imperative reflects the cognitive dissonance we experience between our lives governed by technological acceleration and the frenzy of our existence on one hand, and the need to take time to connect with each other on the other. It expresses the urgency to slow down and pause in the face of environmental upheavals. For its fourth year, the Living Workshop chooses to slow down, to experience moments of suspension and attention, observation and decentering, in tune with life that slowly mutates and reproduces. Students from EESAB (Rennes and Quimper sites), the University Research School "Creative Approaches to Public Space" (Rennes 2 University, ENSAB Rennes), and the Institut Agro Rennes-Angers (Rennes campus) encounter a forest and its artist-forester, Léa Muller, to experience the time of trees, hibernation, harvests, and regeneration.Two study days punctuate and enrich this experience. While enabling the sharing of experiences and projects carried out in the forest by students, they provide an opportunity to open up to other horizons, other artistic, philosophical, and scientific approaches that weave temporalities resistant to the acceleration imperative, in connection with the living world. About ten speakers are invited to share their work, engaging in dialogue with the fruits harvested and transformed by l’Atelier Vivant.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Practical informations <br><br> <br>The study days will take place in two parts:29 March: Workshops with the guest artists (Léa Müller, Thierry Boutonnier, Sinead McDonald, Isabelle Ligeron) (reserved for students at Atelier Vivant and ESAD Valence).30 March: Round-table discussion on regeneration and cycles in the face of accelerating human activity and the impossibility of ecosystems recovering their equilibrium.Open to all, subject to availabilityInstitut Agro Angers-RennesBâtiment 24 from 10.00 am to 12.30 pm -- Bâtiment 15 - Amphi Roux, from 2.00 pm to 5.00 pmTranslated with DeepL.com (free version)<br><br><br><br><br><br>Connections with the event
