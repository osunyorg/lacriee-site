        <p>For the last four years, Léa Muller has been cultivating the three plots of her forest at Chalouzais. She plants, cultivates, cuts, inhabits, tests, observes and combines the wild and the domestic.<br></p><p>The residency she is running there throughout the 2023-2024 season, at the invitation of La Criée, will enable her to invite other artists, researchers, neighbouring farmers, pupils and students to share their experiences and thoughts on the subject of regeneration. This pooling of approaches and views will help to build links and alliances between species, landscapes and practices. And to ask ourselves: what is art? A practice of observation? A practice of seeding and rooting? A practice of repair and regeneration?<br></p><p><em>D'après la tempête</em> marks a stage in Léa Muller's residency, as she sets out to offer an intimate moment of sharing with the forest and the species that live there. The scars of storm Ciaran will be revealed here and there, as will the regeneration experiments that Léa is carrying out to support the natural dynamics of her forest.</p><p>As they stroll along, visitors will also have the chance to discover visual and sound research, take part in a writing workshop and learn about primitive cooking techniques.Finally, at dusk, there will be a gathering around the kiln to extend this sensory and artistic experience.<br></p><p>The residency of Léa Muller and her guests is part of Territoires EXTRA #7.<br></p><p> <strong>With Léa Muller and the participation of</strong><br></p><p>-- Johanna Rocard, writer and performer<br></p><p>-- Charlotte Beltzung, potter<br></p><p>-- Noémie Nocus, archaeobotanist and anthracologist<br></p><p>-- Amélie Taillard, experimental cook and baker<br></p><p>-- Atelier Vivant brings together students from EESAB, ENSAB, EUR CAPS at Rennes 2 University and the Institut Agro Rennes - Angers.</p>
