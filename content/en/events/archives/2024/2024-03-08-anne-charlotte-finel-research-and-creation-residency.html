        <p>During this residency, Anne-Charlotte Finel will have the opportunity to capture images and sounds for one or more future works. On this island at the ends of the earth, battered by the winds, a point of passage for many birds, rich in stories and legends, the artist wishes to continue her explorations of the image-movement, following the rhythm of the tides and the passage of animals on the island. For Anne-Charlotte Finel, Ushant will function as an <sup>  </sup>amplifier<sup>**</sup>.<br></p><p>This residency follows on from the artist's first residency on another island in the Ponant, Île-Molène, in 2019 (which took place as part of the Territoires EXTRA programme). With its 100 inhabitants and its highest point twenty-six metres above sea level, Molène offers both a minimal landscape and the richest seaweed park in Europe. These landscapes provided the setting and inspiration for his films Des sirènes au fond des yeux and Noir Goemon.<br></p><p>More generally, Anne-Charlotte Finel is regularly interested in and nourished by the contexts of the islands: she has taken up residencies at Casa Conti, in Oletta and Cap Corse, Corsica (2021) and an exhibition in Hydra, Greece (<i>Les sirènes étaient des femmes oiseaux</i>, with Lido Kattou, 2022).</p><p>  </p><p><b>Finis Terrae - floating island art centre in Finistère, France</b><br></p><p>Finis terrae - Centre d'art insulaire is developing an innovative residency programme for artists and writers, based on the island of Ushant. An annual programme of residencies gives French and foreign artists the opportunity to stay at the Créac'h semaphore, which is owned by and a project of the Finistère Departmental Council, with the aim of producing an artistic reflection or a work of art linked to the context. Tailor-made expeditions also provide opportunities for residencies, dissemination and cooperation on the Ponant islands, Saint-Pierre and Miquelon and, more broadly, on the maritime environment and coastline, in Finistère and around the world. Finis terrae - Centre d'art insulaire, flottant, finistérien et mondial, encourages movement, distance and perspective, essential for the development of artistic research and practice, by tackling issues linked to the sea, isolation, landscape, insularity and local culture.</p>

      notes: >-
        <p>** The expression comes from Marcel Dinahet, artist and founder of Finis terrae: « In Ouessant, the island has a dimension that is interesting to experience physically. It's just spread out for us to walk around and discover. You could say that the island is an amplifier! »<br></p>
