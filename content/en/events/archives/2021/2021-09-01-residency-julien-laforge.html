        <p>Based on research on the history and cartography of the Dol-de-Bretagne region, the artist initiated the production of a sculptural work—both individual and collective—in collaboration with second-year CAP Carpenter Manufacturer students.</p><p><i>Drawing from the geographical and hydrographical context of Dol-de-Bretagne, a town located on a river bend, the project revolves around an investigation into the sinuous shape of meanders. Due to its relatively flat terrain and proximity to Mont-Saint-Michel Bay, the Dol-de-Bretagne region remains a flood-prone area conducive to the formation of meanders.</i></p><p><i>We approach this shape from cartographic, ecological, gestural, and sensory perspectives to develop a repertoire of forms.</i></p><p><i>The diversity of molded profiles in carpentry, along with the use of twisted wood in naval construction, serves as a foundation for designing a collective object. We seek to rediscover traces of this shape in a context where woodworking professions are increasingly standardized, with winding paths often abandoned in favor of more direct ones. Indeed, the carpentry trade is undergoing significant changes in its practices, materials, and gestures, driven by evolving lifestyles and intense competition from mass retail. </i>(Julien Laforge)</p><p>Following a heritage visit to the Dol-de-Bretagne marshlands, Julien Laforge and the CAP students compiled a repertoire of forms inspired by the landscape to create a sculptural ensemble featuring bas-reliefs. The works are exhibited in May at the Dol-de-Bretagne media library and in June at the Alphonse Pellé vocational high school.<em> </em></p>
