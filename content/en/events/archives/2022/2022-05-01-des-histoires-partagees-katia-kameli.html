    About <br><br> <br>The song Hab El Baroud was written by Algerian poet Hanani Lahouari in response to the centenary celebration of French colonization in Algeria in 1931 and the Universal Exhibition in Paris. Hanani remains relatively unknown, even though his lyrics contributed to the success of contemporary raï stars (such as Cheb Khaled), who, however, performed a modified version. Over time, this song has become an essential love song at wedding celebrations. Katia Kameli has explored its translation and shared an interview with Nabil Djedouani on the history of raï music for Revue #2 of Lili, la rozell et le marimba, published by La Criée.Pour Des Histoires partagées, l’artiste Katia Kameli a réalisé trois vidéos à découvrir en classe, où elle présente aux élèves :For Des Histoires Partagées Artist Katia Kameli has created three videos for classroom viewing, in which she presents to students:-- Her artistic approach and work from her studio.-- Her piece Ya Rayi, which recounts the memory of raï music through her encounters (the work is part of the Frac Bretagne collection).-- A workshop proposal, accompanied by a practical guide to help students create a video clip in class.La Criée has partnered with the Collège La Binquenais and Édulab to offer 3ème (9th grade) students discovery sessions and hands-on experience with various filmmaking techniques, including green screen filming and stop-motion animation, to assist in producing their own music videos.In return, participating classes will be invited to explore Katia Kameli’s exhibition at La Criée and meet the artist during an event on June 14 at Frac Bretagne.As part of EXPORAMA, Katia Kameli is also hosting a Raï evening, featuring her performance My Anthology of Raï, followed by a concert by Sofiane Saïdi and a DJ set by Acid Arab, on September 17 at Antipode.<br><br><br><br><br><br> <br>partnerships    la Binquenais Secondary school, Rennes    DAAC – Académie de Rennes    édulab, Rennes    Frac Bretagnesupports    Drac Bretagne,in the context of  L’art à nos fenêtres, 2020meetings and workshops with secondary school students    16 march : presentation of Katia Kameli’s videos at the secondary school     23 march : introduction to stop-motion and green screen tools at the edulab    25 et 30 march : story-boards creations    6 april : videos clips shooting at the édulab    4 may : video editing    1er june : visit Katia Kameli’s exhibition in La Criée    14 june : meeting with Katia Kameli in the secondary school and at 6:30 in the Frac Bretagne, Katia Kameli & la Smala<br><br><br><br><br><br> <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Artiste<br><br><br>Connections with the project
