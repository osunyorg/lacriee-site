    Isabelle Arthuis Residency and workshop - Fantaisies
  summary: >-
    <p>Invited to take part in the public commission for metro line B (Gros Chêne station), Isabelle Arthuis plans to create a series of posters in the public space and an exhibition to inaugurate the new site of the Musée des Beaux-Arts in Maurepas.</p>
  body: >-
    <p>About  <br>   <br>Isabelle Arthuis creates images that take different forms depending on the contexts and places where she works: film or digital photographs, very large format posters that she often displays in public spaces, photo & video installations, artist books, slideshows in which she plays true visual and chromatic sequences, or films that she treats in an almost pictorialist manner.The Fantaisies project proposes to explore the paintings of the Rennes Museum of Fine Arts, to identify characters, sets, places, objects, or actions that will constitute the material to create photographs, both personal and collective with groups of Maurepas residents. <br>The aim is to find a way of writing with images from the past to build a contemporary story. A series of black and white portraits from the museum's large paintings will be placed outside in display panels. In the museum's new branch, for the future exhibition, a grand narrative will be articulated, consisting of a selection of photographs, sculptures, and paintings.Based on these emblematic images from the Rennes Museum of Fine Arts, I suggest a unique reading of artworks where everyone can project their stories and thus invent new narratives. My project is an invitation to see Art and to encounter it as you exit the Maurepas metro station. [...]Fantaisie questions our relationship with art, examines its current challenges and the ways of seeing, making, and showing artworks today. <br>Isabelle Arthuis</p>  <p>   <br>partnership :-- Musée des beaux-arts de Rennes-- Direction de quartiers Nord-Est de la Ville de Rennes-- Rennes City Department of Cultureproduction :-- La Criée center d'art contemporain-- Musée des beaux-arts de Rennesphotographic workshop :-- Isabelle Arthuis invites the residents of Maurepas to a session of meetings and photographic workshops at the Musée des beaux-arts (quai Zola)</p>  <p> Connections with the residency  </p>
