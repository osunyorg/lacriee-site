    About <br><br> <br>The FLE (French as a Foreign Language) teachers at Bulles de français aim to facilitate language learning by prioritizing exchanges and encounters between a group of learners and cultural mediators, artists, Master 2 students in Exhibition Arts and Professions from Rennes 2 University, and visitors of La Criée. The association's distinctive feature is working in situ at partner locations and co-creating with learners/users, volunteers, and/or professionals: utilizing everyone's skills to implement a common project.Starting from their discovery of Bertille Bak's exhibition Dark-en-ciel and their impressions, the learners conducted interviews with La Criée visitors, various exhibition professionals, and the artist. They visited behind the scenes of Bertille Bak's exhibition Le mouton est dans le salon at the Art & Essai gallery with MAE students from Rennes 2 University and participated in workshops with La Criée's cultural mediators to experiment with creating simplified communication documents. The learners set up their radio studio at the edulab and Hôtel Pasteur to create podcasts. These combine recordings of the exhibitions' sound environments with interviews and the creation of a narrative inspired by artist Bertille Bak's offbeat universe. These podcasts, intended for Rennes metropolitan area residents, will be available simultaneously on La Criée's and Bulles de français' websites and possibly on radio waves...<br>Bulles de français: The association Bulles de français (french Bubbles), established in 2021 in Rennes, is the result of experience sharing and reflection by professionals who are passionate about teaching French as a Foreign Language (FLE).
