        <p>Thomas Gaugain trained in woodworking, then in lace and embroidery techniques, before graduating from the European School of Art in Brittany. His journey has led him to reinterpret artisanal gestures and practices to produce works using mixed techniques and materials.</p><p>For the Rennes women's prison, he envisions filming a movie exploring the fictional potential of objects, particularly textiles: <em>It would be a condensed version of the roles of screenwriter, costume designer, and videographer, as the proposal encompasses these three activities. The first step would be to compose a collective story, drawing from texts, documentaries about textiles, personal stories, current events, news items, dreams... in a rather whimsical and offbeat tone. From this script would emerge a number of objects that would provide a context/set/costumes where we will play the roles of invented characters, where the film would serve as the final presentation. This would be an opportunity to pass on textile techniques that I have learned, so that the inmates can make them their own, but also to observe the connections and exchanges that exist between Facts and making.</em> (Artist's statement by Thomas Gaugain)</p>
