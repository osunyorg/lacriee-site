summary: >-
  <p>Mathis Collins carves wood into figures laughing or crying, mocking and mute. He begins by roughing out different planes in the thickness of boards, then gouges their surface so that the force, angle and attack of each stroke definitively mark their volumes and textures.</p>

        <p>The black outlines and colours he uses to embellish these bas-reliefs  are likewise obtained by elimination: after painting his chosen  surfaces, he sands them back, leaving only the coloured residue in the  grain of the wood. In addition to being unpredictable – a knot suddenly  pops out, leaving a hole – this method is slow to bring forth its  smeared faces, wan street-lighting and pale sunrises. Self-taught,  Collins is now a master of his craft, but he shares with practitioners  of art brut a mortal horror of a vacuum. Here he has complemented his  carved compositions with moving parts whose rudimentary mechanisms  reveal a parade of tricolour cockades that pass for targets. </p><p>All this toil to produce these primitive shapes leaves Collins’s  errant characters the time to clamber up from the limbo of their  micro-histories to the surface of a limewood plank. Sometimes undertaken  bit by bit and involving the mouths, feet, noses and hats of people  with sometimes no more than the costumes on their backs, this is quite a  journey. The launchpad, in Paris around 1680, was something between the  premises of the Comédie Française and the trestles of street theatre.  So much for the overall picture: the theatre that took shape in the  city’s fairs was the core factor in the rivalry between the Comédie  Française and the Commedia dell’arte. Jealous of the popularity of the   streetwise competition, the tiny élite of « the King’s troupe » persuaded  Louis XIV to grant them exclusive rights to on-stage dialogue in French  – with armed enforcement from the police. The dissident troupes,  however, very quickly found canny modes of resistance: placards were  displayed and marionettes and ropewalkers spoke; mimes mimed; actors and  actresses delivered monologues, replying from among the crowd or  letting the crowd itself reply; speech bubbles were brought out; there  was gibberish in Latin. Result: all sorts of gambits for subverting the  academic constraints of classical theatre.</p><p>For Collins the emergence of these Parisian proto-countercultures  driven by working-class dissent has become an image source and the  underpinning of a transhistorical narrative he has been monitoring with  regard to himself and his time. This is the history of the control of  voices, bodies and behaviour, impelled by a network of skilled mimes who  have rendered it more discreet, more nuanced and more democratic. Given  today’s omnipresent abuses of power, Collins resorts to all the  costumes. His work is peopled by comical, solitary alter egos –  artist-clown, artist-educator, artist-cop – sprung from the popular  archetypes of the Commedia dell’arte, carnivals, bistros, life after  dark, and  art and culture education programmes for sensitive urban  areas. He is the mime who knowingly exaggerates, who works both sides of  the fence, gifted with an ambiguous silence. He is the watchful cop who  sometimes lashes out, the bureaucrat who gives orders, the mediator who  reconciles, the clown trying to act the buffoon, the willing public or  the guy with his own idea of art. He is also his artist father, invited  here to help him invent a different kind of interactive aesthetic.  Through them, he mimes.</p><p>A conversation about the artistic value of artistic education is  taking place here between two artists, a son and a father. Each of them  is also a teacher: the former in creative workshops, the latter in an  art school. At issue are work processes and their reciprocal influences.</p><p>In his new series, <em>History of Modern Art</em>, Paul Collins looks  back to his art studies in Toronto in the 1970s, reproducing pages from  the books that impacted his training either academically or  aesthetically: the school textbook <em>History of Modern Art</em> by H.H Arnason, the art magazine <em>Parachute</em>,  a catalogue of the painter Robert Motherwell, a typographical  composition guide, a grid setting out the standard canvas formats  according to the pictorial genres « portrait, landscape, marine », and a  page of concrete poetry. Already famous by that time was <em>The Medium Is the Massage</em>  (1967), by Marshall McLuhan and graphic designer Quentin Fiore, a book  whose title wittily exploited a typographical error in the media’s  handling of a phrase that had become a slogan: <em>The medium is the message.</em>  McLuhan’s theory was that the medium was the true vehicle of  information, and described a form of collusion between the channel (the  medium) and its content (the message). While McLuhan was paving the way  for « media studies » in Canada, Paul Collins was making the transition  from experimental « free schools » to university lecture theatres. The  hallucinatory effects of a massage with a message can be applied to  Collins’s paintings because they are based on printed documents which,  in the course of their successive modulations, have both lost some of  their content and gained a certain sensuality.</p><p>Replicated by means of overlaid, slightly out of register grids, text  and illustrations dissolve into shimmering, more or less dense coloured  areas. In the course of its transfers from one medium to another – from  printed page to photocopy to canvas – the message seems to have  evaporated on contact with the canvas, giving way to free-floating  images. These pictorial processes show Collins returning to the printing  profession he learned hands-on at the same period, working in  independent publishing houses.</p><p>Here, in his<em> History of Modern Art</em>, he recounts a personal  journey in the context of a collective visual culture: in other words a  late 20th-century, vernacular vision of art in a North American vein.</p><p><em>— Émilie Renard</em></p>
