        <p>The residency she will be running there throughout the 2023-2024  season, at the invitation of La Criée, will enable her to invite other  artists, researchers and experimenters, as well as neighbouring farmers  and hunters, schoolchildren and students, to share their experiences and  thoughts on the subject of regeneration. This pooling of approaches and  viewpoints will contribute to building links and alliances between  species, landscapes and practices.</p><p>The question is: what constitutes art? A practice of observation? A  practice of seeding and rooting? A practice of repairing and  regeneration?</p>

      notes: >-
        <p>The residency of Léa Muller and her guests is part of Territoires EXTRA #7</p>
