    The multiplicity of stars (La multiplicité des étoiles) Gabrielle Manglou, Lucie Férézou, Margaux Janisset
  summary: >-
    <p> From November 2024 until May 2025, students at Jean Moulin School explore new artistic approaches through several workshops led by  Gabrielle Manglou, Lucie Férézou, and Margaux Janisset  </p>
  body: >-
    <p>About  <br>   <br>In the continuation of the project  Wonders  which took place in early 2024, the students of the Jean Moulin school conducted workshop sessions with artist Gabrielle Manglou from November to December 2024. It proposed protocols inspired by a work combining printed images and materials collected in nature. It has been produced and published in limited edition in November. Students are able to find the artist, share their memories and discover the purpose of the  Wonders  with the work produced.  From January to May 2025, students are able to understand new artistic approaches. Margaux Janisset and Lucie Férézou both lead a pictorial practice and  in situ  very inspired by the nature and environment in which they work. They also develop correspondence practices and are particularly interested in micro-publishing. For the Jean Moulin school, they imagine several forms of workshops around the creation of paintings, posters or embroidery in small formats, which are broadcasted on the walls of the school and outside, on a district scale. They conduct in parallel or alternately different workshop sessions with the two classes of CE2 in order to produce a common objects or echoing each other. This takes the form of multiples that can be disseminated to the parents of students and within La Criée.</p>  <p> Pictures of the residency  <br>  </p>  <p>Photos - Noé Péan</p>  <p> Connection with the residency  </p>
