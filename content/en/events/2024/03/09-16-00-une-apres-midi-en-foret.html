    D’après les tempêtes, une après-midi en forêt Léa Muller
  summary: >-
    <p>As part of her residency with the La Criée contemporary art centre throughout the 2023-2024 season, Léa Muller invites you to share and discover her forest through walks, performances, primitive cooking and tastings.</p>
  body: >-
    <p>About  <br>   <br>For the last four years, Léa Muller has been cultivating the three plots of her forest at Chalouzais. She plants, cultivates, cuts, inhabits, tests, observes and combines the wild and the domestic.The residency she is running there throughout the 2023-2024 season, at the invitation of La Criée, will enable her to invite other artists, researchers, neighbouring farmers, pupils and students to share their experiences and thoughts on the subject of regeneration. This pooling of approaches and views will help to build links and alliances between species, landscapes and practices. And to ask ourselves: what is art? A practice of observation? A practice of seeding and rooting? A practice of repair and regeneration?D'après la tempête marks a stage in Léa Muller's residency, as she sets out to offer an intimate moment of sharing with the forest and the species that live there. The scars of storm Ciaran will be revealed here and there, as will the regeneration experiments that Léa is carrying out to support the natural dynamics of her forest.As they stroll along, visitors will also have the chance to discover visual and sound research, take part in a writing workshop and learn about primitive cooking techniques.Finally, at dusk, there will be a gathering around the kiln to extend this sensory and artistic experience.The residency of Léa Muller and her guests is part of Territoires EXTRA #7. With Léa Muller and the participation of-- Johanna Rocard, writer and performer-- Charlotte Beltzung, potter-- Noémie Nocus, archaeobotanist and anthracologist-- Amélie Taillard, experimental cook and baker-- Atelier Vivant brings together students from EESAB, ENSAB, EUR CAPS at Rennes 2 University and the Institut Agro Rennes - Angers.</p>  <p> Practical informations  <br>   <br>Detailed programme Between 3pm and 5.30pm: a walk through the forest with meetings, readings, on-site productions and a writing workshop.From 4.30 to 5.30 pm: a time for sharing knowledge and going back in time to the forests with Charlotte Beltzung, potter and Noémie Nocus, anthracologist.5.45pm: Performance ceremony to open the banquet6pm to 7pm: Tastings at duskAnd all afternoon, discover primitive firings!</p>  <p> Forêt de l’Aubriais, Bourg-des-Comptes  <br>Carte de la forêt de la Chalouzais, Bourg-des-Comptes (Bretagne, France)</p>  <p>   <br>Make sure you have good shoes!Parking on the outskirts of the plot is tricky: car-pooling, walking or cycling are preferable.</p>  <p> Documentation  <br>   <br>Communiqué de presse</p>  <p> Connections with the event  </p>

        <p>For the last four years, Léa Muller has been cultivating the three plots of her forest at Chalouzais. She plants, cultivates, cuts, inhabits, tests, observes and combines the wild and the domestic.</p><p>The residency she is running there throughout the 2023-2024 season, at the invitation of La Criée, will enable her to invite other artists, researchers, neighbouring farmers, pupils and students to share their experiences and thoughts on the subject of regeneration. This pooling of approaches and views will help to build links and alliances between species, landscapes and practices. And to ask ourselves: what is art? A practice of observation? A practice of seeding and rooting? A practice of repair and regeneration?</p><p><em>D'après la tempête</em> marks a stage in Léa Muller's residency, as she sets out to offer an intimate moment of sharing with the forest and the species that live there. The scars of storm Ciaran will be revealed here and there, as will the regeneration experiments that Léa is carrying out to support the natural dynamics of her forest.</p><p>As they stroll along, visitors will also have the chance to discover visual and sound research, take part in a writing workshop and learn about primitive cooking techniques.Finally, at dusk, there will be a gathering around the kiln to extend this sensory and artistic experience.</p><p>The residency of Léa Muller and her guests is part of Territoires EXTRA #7.</p><p> <strong>With Léa Muller and the participation of</strong></p><p>-- Johanna Rocard, writer and performer</p><p>-- Charlotte Beltzung, potter</p><p>-- Noémie Nocus, archaeobotanist and anthracologist</p><p>-- Amélie Taillard, experimental cook and baker</p><p>-- Atelier Vivant brings together students from EESAB, ENSAB, EUR CAPS at Rennes 2 University and the Institut Agro Rennes - Angers.</p>
