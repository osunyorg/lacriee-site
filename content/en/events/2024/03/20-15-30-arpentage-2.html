    <p>About  <br>   <br>To coincide with Anne-Charlotte Finel's exhibition  Respiro  , we invite you to take another look at the book  Dans l'œil du crocodile  by Val Plumwood . In February 1985, the environmental philosopher Val Plumwood survived - against all the odds - a crocodile attack in Australia's Kakadu National Park. In Plumwood's eyes, inspired as she was by the mythological tales of the Australian Aborigines and the ancient Egyptians, the crocodile is a  trickster , a creature that harshly judges human beings' pretence to extricate themselves from the cycle of life. Unfinished at the time of the author's death, this story is supplemented by four essays on our relationship with living things: on the death of a wombat, on vegan ontology, on the film  Babe: the pig who became a shepherd , and on life in our cemeteries. Dans l'œil du crocodile  is not just a tale of survival, it's also a unique reflection on the meaning of our human lives, our struggles and our deaths. A great life lesson about vulnerability and living together. (source: Wildproject)</p>  <p> Practical informations  <br>   <br>Val Plumwood (1939-2008) is an ecofeminist philosopher. Her work, consisting of three books and over 80 articles, is a major contribution to feminist philosophy and ecological thought. -- free -- 20 places available</p>  <p> Connections with the event  </p>
