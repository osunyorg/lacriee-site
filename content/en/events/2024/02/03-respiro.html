    Respiro Anne-Charlotte Finel
  summary: >-
    <p>Camera in hand, Anne-Charlotte Finel explores interstices and boundary zones: between light and darkness, wild and man-made spaces, animal and plant, human and non-human, living and machine, etc. With its exploration of these thresholds, the Respiro exhibition at La Criée centre d’art contemporain offers a visual and aural experience that questions and blurs the contours of our perceptions and representations.  </p>

    <p>About  <br>   <br>In  Respiro , a first version of which was presented in autumn <br> 2023 at the Centre d’Art de Saint-Fons, Anne-Charlotte Finel draws on a <br> series of recent pieces to create an environment made of darkness and  <br>shards of light, of furtive yet slow movements, of blurs, details and  <br>materials. To create her sometimes phantasmagorical images, the artist  <br>uses only her camera. There’s no  mise en scène , just a patient, <br> attentive recording of the living; an alliance between the artist’s eye <br> and the mechano-electronic eye of her camera. <br> At La Criée, the artist has reconfigured the space of the art centre  <br>into three areas, structured by oblique partitions. Each area plunges  <br>the visitor into an atmosphere that is both specific and permeable to  <br>the neighbouring spaces, through a slight diffusion effect. The ensemble <br> is underpinned by a soundtrack composed by Voiski that reinforces the  <br>impression of detachment from reality with its abstract and naturalistic <br> electronic layers. The first room presents the film  Paon  (Peacock) in a  <br>luminous, vibrant atmosphere. The close-ups and motion effects on the  <br>bird’s plumage create a colourful abstraction that challenges our  <br>conventional representations of animals and landscapes. The next space we enter, which is bathed in half-light, is centred around the  Klopotec  <br> film, which employs a much broader field of vision. In this film  <br>Anne-Charlotte Finel focuses her camera on the runways at Orly airport  <br>and in particular the surrounding countryside. She films both the planes <br> and the birds taking to the skies. She follows some of the species that <br> have found a home in these Anthropocene grasslands. Here, between the  <br>dimness and the haziness of distance, the lines between technology and  <br>nature, between the realm of the wild and that of human intervention,  <br>are blurred. The final section of the exhibition features the installation  Passagers  <br> (Passengers)**, for which Anne-Charlotte Finel filmed and photographed  <br>crocodile, alligator, calf and silkworm farms in Zimbabwe, Zambia,  <br>Florida, Switzerland and France. </p>  <p> Passagers  is composed of a superposition of images, printed  <br>on different silks suspended or stretched in a metal structure. It is  <br>accompanied by two films –  Respiro  and  Nuit  – and  <br>other prints. In the midst of all these details, transparencies and  <br>opacities, the uncertainty grows even greater: we are no longer quite  <br>sure which animal we are looking at, whether it is an animal or a plant  <br>or something else, or even if we’re not the ones being watched. In Anne-Charlotte Finel’s exhibition  Respiro , bodies,  <br>materials and landscapes superpose and often merge to create a chimera, a <br> surreal environment where the organic and the cosmopolitic resonate. <br>** Anne-Charlotte Finel produced  Passagers  as part of a LVMH Métiers d’Art residency in 2022 The first phase of the “Respiro” exhibition will be on show at the CAP  <br>Centre d’art de Saint-Fons from 23 September to 10 November 2023.</p>  <p> partnership </p>  <p>CAP Saint Fons <br>https://lecap-saintfons.com/</p>  <p> Photography of the exhibition  <br>  </p>  <p>  <br>Photo - Marc Domage</p>  <p>View of the exhibition  Respiro  by Anne Charlotte Finel, La Criée centre d'art contemporain, Rennes, from 03 February to 28 April 2024 </p>  <p>Photo - Marc Domage</p>  <p> </p>  <p>Anne-Charlotte Finel,  Bombyx , 2023, photographic print on organza 40 x 50 cm, view of the exhibition  Respiro , La Criée centre d'art contemporain, Rennes, from 03 February to 28 April 2024</p>  <p>Photo - Marc Domage</p>  <p>View of the exhibition  Respiro  by Anne Charlotte Finel, La Criée centre d'art contemporain, Rennes, from 03 February to 28 April 2024 </p>  <p>Photo - Marc Domage</p>  <p>Anne-Charlotte <br> Finel,  Klopotec n°6 , 2022-2023, fresson print mounted on aluminium 40 x 53 cm, view of the exhibition  Respiro , La Criée centre d'art contemporain, Rennes, from 03 February to 28 April 2024 </p>  <p>Photo - Marc Domage</p>  <p>View of the exhibition  Respiro  by Anne Charlotte Finel, La Criée centre d'art contemporain, Rennes, from 03 February to 28 April 2024 </p>  <p>Photo - Marc Domage</p>  <p>Anne-Charlotte Finel,  La Crue,  2016, HD colour video -- music by Voiski, 2017 -- 6'32'', view of the exhibition  Respiro , La Criée centre d'art contemporain, Rennes, from 03 February to 28 April 2024 </p>  <p>Photo - Marc Domage</p>  <p>Anne-Charlotte <br> Finel,  Passagers , 2022, Steel structure, wooden frame and silk organza, satin, 210 cm x 270 cm x 290 cm, view of the exhibition  Respiro , La Criée centre d'art contemporain, Rennes, from 03 February to 28 April 2024 </p>  <p>Photo - Marc Domage</p>  <p>Anne-Charlotte <br> Finel,  Paon , 2021, digital colour video -- music by Voiski -- 3'36'', view of the exhibition  Respiro , La Criée centre d'art contemporain, Rennes, from 03 February to 28 April 2024 -</p>  <p> Events  <br> Artist and curator  <br>  </p>  <p>Artiste</p>  <p>Commissaire</p>  <p> Documentation  <br>   <br>Dossier de presse "Respiro", Anne-Charlotte Finel</p>  <p>Communiqué presse "Respiro", Anne-Charlotte Finel</p>  <p> Connections with the exhibition  </p>
