    Devil’s Island Hubert Czerepok
  summary: >-
    <p> At La Criée Centre for Contemporary Art for his first solo exhibition in  France, Polish artist Hubert Czerepok takes a hard, thoughtful look at  contemporary representations of power.  </p>
  body: >-
    <p>About  <br>   <br>At the core of his oeuvre are the connections  <br>between fiction, topicality and historical events. It is not the facts  <br>themselves that interest the artist, but rather the way they begin with  <br>shifts, mutations, and unimaginable formal and semantic transformations. <br> Drawing, installation, video and photography: Czerepok's strength lies  <br>in always choosing the most effective medium for each subject.</p>  <p>For  Devil's Island , the video installation on show at La  <br>Criée, the artist visited the rocky islet off the coast of Kourou in  <br>French Guiana, famed for the penal colony to which many French political <br> prisoners - including Alfred Dreyfus - were condemned. The images he  <br>brought back are projected onto a hexagonal sculpture referencing  <br>another form of disciplinary power: the Panopticon. Part of a circular  <br>prison building, the Panopticon allows full-time surveillance of  <br>prisoners without their knowing if they are being watched or not, the  <br>result being a sense of invisible omniscience. Designed by  <br>philosopher-jurist Jeremy Bentham in 1870, the Panopticon came under  <br>critical scrutiny in Michel Foucault's book  Discipline and Punish  <br> published in 1975. Using as his model the hexagonal Panopticon in the  <br>women's prison in Rennes, France, Czerepok triggers in the exhibition  <br>space a maelstrom of images and a revolving of our gaze that turns the  <br>Panopticon against itself. <br>The exhibition also includes a series of drawings,  Seances ,  <br>which brings together media images relating to some tragic current  <br>event, spiritualist seances or sexual scenes. The initial Seances series <br> retained only a minimal trace of the originals, while the images made  <br>for the Rennes exhibition combine areas of flat black with line drawing. <br> Here Czerepok pays tribute to Goya's  Disasters of War  engravings <br> and their demonstration of all the atrocious cruelty mankind is capable <br> of. In this new look at glamorised, mass-produced media violence, the  <br>artist forces the image back into its genuinely traumatising, critical  <br>role. <br>The  Devil's Island  exhibition comprises a highly diverse  <br>selection of works that lead us to reflect on different forms of power,  <br>the way they are depicted and the impact of this depiction on our lives</p>  <p> partnerships </p>  <p>Institut culturel polonais, Paris <br>https://instytutpolski.pl/paris/</p>  <p> Photos de l’exposition  <br>  </p>  <p>                     Hubert Czerepok,   vue de l’exposition  Devil’s Island , La Criée centre d’art contemporain, Rennes, 2009 © Benoît Mauras  <br>            </p>  <p>Hubert Czerepok,   vue de l’exposition  Devil’s Island , La Criée centre d’art contemporain, Rennes, 2009 © Benoît Mauras</p>  <p>Hubert Czerepok,   vue de l’exposition  Devil’s Island , La Criée centre d’art contemporain, Rennes, 2009 © Benoît Mauras</p>  <p>Hubert Czerepok,   vue de l’exposition  Devil’s Island , La Criée centre d’art contemporain, Rennes, 2009 © Benoît Mauras</p>  <p>Hubert Czerepok,   vue de l’exposition  Devil’s Island , La Criée centre d’art contemporain, Rennes, 2009 © Benoît Mauras</p>  <p>Hubert Czerepok,   vue de l’exposition  Devil’s Island , La Criée centre d’art contemporain, Rennes, 2009 © Benoît Mauras</p>  <p>Hubert Czerepok,   vue de l’exposition  Devil’s Island , La Criée centre d’art contemporain, Rennes, 2009 © Benoît Mauras</p>  <p>Hubert Czerepok,   vue de l’exposition  Devil’s Island , La Criée centre d’art contemporain, Rennes, 2009 © Benoît Mauras</p>  <p> Produced works  <br> Artist and curator  <br> Connection with the exhibition  </p>

        <p> At the core of his oeuvre are the connections  between fiction, topicality and historical events. It is not the facts  themselves that interest the artist, but rather the way they begin with  shifts, mutations, and unimaginable formal and semantic transformations.  Drawing, installation, video and photography: Czerepok's strength lies  in always choosing the most effective medium for each subject.  For <i>Devil's Island</i>, the video installation on show at La  Criée, the artist visited the rocky islet off the coast of Kourou in  French Guiana, famed for the penal colony to which many French political  prisoners - including Alfred Dreyfus - were condemned. The images he  brought back are projected onto a hexagonal sculpture referencing  another form of disciplinary power: the Panopticon. Part of a circular  prison building, the Panopticon allows full-time surveillance of  prisoners without their knowing if they are being watched or not, the  result being a sense of invisible omniscience. Designed by  philosopher-jurist Jeremy Bentham in 1870, the Panopticon came under  critical scrutiny in Michel Foucault's book <i>Discipline and Punish</i>  published in 1975. Using as his model the hexagonal Panopticon in the  women's prison in Rennes, France, Czerepok triggers in the exhibition  space a maelstrom of images and a revolving of our gaze that turns the  Panopticon against itself. The exhibition also includes a series of drawings, <i>Seances</i>,  which brings together media images relating to some tragic current  event, spiritualist seances or sexual scenes. The initial Seances series  retained only a minimal trace of the originals, while the images made  for the Rennes exhibition combine areas of flat black with line drawing.  Here Czerepok pays tribute to Goya's <i>Disasters of War</i> engravings  and their demonstration of all the atrocious cruelty mankind is capable  of. In this new look at glamorised, mass-produced media violence, the  artist forces the image back into its genuinely traumatising, critical  role. The <i>Devil's Island</i> exhibition comprises a highly diverse  selection of works that lead us to reflect on different forms of power,  the way they are depicted and the impact of this depiction on our lives  </p>
