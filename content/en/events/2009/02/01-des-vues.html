    <p> La Criée is repeating its project of artists' residence in primary  schools in Priority Education Areas, in partnership with the City of  Rennes, the Brittany Region Cultural Affairs Office (Drac) and the  Ministry of Education. The goal is to improve access to culture in  educationally deprived areas and develop long-term art and culture  education programmes while supporting creative projects by artists in  the territories concerned.  </p>

    <p>About  <br>   <br>These residencies are intended as long-term ventures, in the  <br>interests of allowing the children to try out an artistic approach,  <br>discover the creative process leading to a work of art, and develop a  <br>special relationship with the artists. The aim is also to provide other  <br>forms of learning by stimulating pupils' sensory intelligence,  <br>imagination and creativity. The projects are drawn up at the beginning  <br>of the school year in consultation with the teaching staff; in this way  <br>the educational objectives are jointly defined, together with a  <br>framework of practical work and exchange that suits both artist and  <br>pupils. <br> For this season La Criée has chosen artists Julie C. Fortier and  <br>Mathilde Seguin, both committed to the principle of generating a  <br>creative process in an educational setting. <br> Des vues <br> Mathilde Seguin will build her project around a series of  <br>installations and engravings titled "Views". She will ask the pupils to  <br>focus on their city and their everyday living space and to use different <br> printing techniques to turn their points of view into multiple images.</p>  <p>partnerships école Kennedy, Rennes académie de Rennes / DSDEN35 pôle enfance du centre social Villejean, Rennes semaine de l’architecture en Bretagne / MAB artothèque, Vitré supports ville de Rennes / DEE et Politique de la ville ministère de la Culture / Drac Bretagne</p>  <p> Produced works  </p>
