    Proust lu / Variations Véronique Aubouy
  summary: >-
    <p> Begun in 1993 for a planned period of 30 years, Véronique Aubouy's <em>Reading Proust</em> trains the camera on people from all kinds of backgrounds reading Marcel Proust's <em>In Search of Lost Time</em>  aloud. Each reading (around 2 pages) is a portrait. The reader has no  choice regarding the text, but can opt for a personal mode of  presentation or dramatisation.  </p>

    <p>About  <br>   <br>Invited to take up a one-year residency at Les Champs Libres,  <br>Véronique Aubouy focuses on the daily life of a city and its environs,  <br>filming 150 people at work or in iconic local settings.  Variations  <br> is an autonomous work based on the idea of depicting a territory via  <br>the interweaving of selected fragments. Her portrait of Greater Rennes  <br>covers all the professions: the postwoman, railway worker, plumber, bus  <br>driver, roofer, archpriest, hatter, cheesemonger and more. The  <br>contemporary notion of the metropolitan area is a key factor in the  <br>making of the images: the diversity of localities and residents, with  <br>city people rubbing shoulders with farmers, highlights this new way of  <br>living together and sharing the same space. <br>This exhibition will take place at Les Champs Libres.  At the same  <br>time La Criée Centre for Contemporary Art will be screening Véronique  <br>Aubouy's readings of Proust by residents in different parts of Greater  <br>Rennes. Here we feel, as it were, a shifting visual and literary  <br>topography joining up with and extending the metropolitan area.</p>  <p> partnerships -- Les Champs Libres, Rennes -- association choses et non choses, Rennes</p>
