    <p>About  <br>   <br>Social Landscape  is launching a new cycle of collaboration between European cultural actors and La Criée, the contemporary art center in Rennes.  Rennes Musique - Silent Disco  is the first public event and will take place as part of the Trans Musicales de Rennes festival. Grab a pair of wireless headphones, listen, and lose yourself in Rockin' Bones, a record store in downtown Rennes. Rennes Musique is a silent disco where art and music come together, producing waves of nostalgia that echo the famous store that recently closed in Rennes, for its regulars and for all those who have a similar connection to their favorite record store. Rather than paying tribute to a particular store, Rennes Musique celebrates the now obsolete activity of hanging out at your favorite record store on Saturday afternoons to listen to and discuss new releases. The selected tracks represent a snapshot of the music that shaped the environment of a dozen French and international artists. During the event, the audience will be able to rediscover this form of conviviality by creating their own performances and imaginary space through dance and the exchange of artistic and musical memories. Taking place as part of the TransMusicales de Rennes festival,  Silent Disco  is dedicated to all music fans and celebrates the festival, whose influence on the city—and beyond—has been felt for thirty years.  <br>in partnership   <br> -- La Criée centre d'art contemporain, Rennes -- Glasgow International Festival of Visual Art -- Les Trans Musicales de Rennes -- école régionale des beaux-arts de Rennes -- Rockin' Bones / rock'n'roll record shop -- culture and Sport City Council of Glasgow -- ville de Rennes </p>  <p> Rennes Musique - Silent Disco is produced by Patricia Fleming with the assistance of Claire Migraine, in collaboration with nine students from Erba who are responsible for collecting and compiling playlists and organizing the event: Guillaume Borde, Leslie Chaudet, Dolores Djafer, Elisa Espen, Valentin Ferré, François Geslin, François Lancien Guilberteau, Alex Lécuiller et Thomas Tudoux.</p>  <p>   <br>SILENT DISCO - Playlists</p>  <p> Connections  </p>
