    <p>About  <br>   <br>These residencies are intended as long-term ventures, in the  <br>interests of allowing the children to try out an artistic approach,  <br>discover the creative process leading to a work of art, and develop a  <br>special relationship with the artists. The aim is also to provide other  <br>forms of learning by stimulating pupils' sensory intelligence,  <br>imagination and creativity. The projects are drawn up at the beginning  <br>of the school year in consultation with the teaching staff; in this way  <br>the educational objectives are jointly defined, together with a  <br>framework of practical work and exchange that suits both artist and  <br>pupils. <br>For this season La Criée has chosen artists Julie C. Fortier and  <br>Mathilde Seguin, both committed to the principle of generating a  <br>creative process in an educational setting. <br> Ma Cabane au Canada <br> Julie C. Fortier intends to experiment with sculpture, working from a still from Charles Chaplin's  The Gold Rush . <br> Via meetings with the artist, workshops, film screenings and the idea  <br>of "moving through the screen", students will be encouraged to go into  <br>the image-making process in greater detail. <br>partnerships -- école Les Gantelles, Rennes -- académie de Rennes / DSDEN35 supports -- ville de Rennes / DEE -- ministère de la Culture / Drac Bretagne</p>  <p>   <br>Dossier de presse</p>  <p> Produced works  </p>
