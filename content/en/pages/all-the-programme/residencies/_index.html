summary: >-
  <p>Each season, La Criée accompanies artists in research, creation and transmission residencies. To this end, the art center provides them with a range of resources: workspaces, technical, human and financial resources. As a tool for supporting production and a driving force behind creation, this scheme enables artists to tackle and develop new projects. A second mission inherent in residencies is to share certain stages of the process with different audiences: meetings, workshops, exhibitions and residency exits.</p>
