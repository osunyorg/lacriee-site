    <p>Each season, La Criée works with artists, researchers, authors and/or associate curators. These partnerships enable us to experiment with new ways of working over the long term, to develop more ambitious projects that extend beyond the timeframe of exhibitions and residencies, and to surround ourselves with allies who bring their interests, ideas and research to our programming. They also encourage new partnerships and the development of special links with the public.</p>
