        <p>Over the years, La Criée has sometimes chosen to organize its programming in the form of cycles. Covering one or more seasons, these cycles enable us to approach a subject from different angles, not only through exhibitions, but also through residencies, events and editions.<br>These thematic cycles make it possible to explore artistic and/or social issues over a long period of time, and to diversify approaches. They give coherence and identity to all the actions of the art center.</p>
