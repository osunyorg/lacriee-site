        <p>La Criée has developed a unique format for an art center, based on a model inspired by live entertainment. Each season, La Criée associates one or more artists with its programming. This collaborative format allows us to experiment with a new way of working over the long term, and to be as close as possible to the creative process and the movements of thought.</p>
