        <p>Every year, La Criée develops a number of partnerships, both regular and occasional, with professionals in the fields of art and culture, as well as education, social work and healthcare. Regular cooperations include the Territoires EXTRA programm, designed with Passerelle art center in Brest and the support of the Drac Bretagne - Ministry of Culture, which has existed since 2017. Territoires EXTRA has a threefold objective: to support emerging artists through production and distribution, to build an artistic project in touch with local actors in Brittany, and to include emerging artists in an international dynamic.<br><br>Thanks to its expertise, the La Criée team is regularly invited to take part in commissions and professional meetings.</p>
