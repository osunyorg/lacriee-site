        <p>From 2013 to 2024, the mediation team will be investing in digital technology through its "Correspondances" contributive platform. Conceived as a place for exchanges, a space for educational and creative resources, which showcases the productions of visiting groups, and a point for sharing interactive games created with artists and young audiences, it is above all a means of creating sensitive links between mediators, audiences (in particular twinned groups and partners in cultural seasons) and artists, and invites everyone to share their artistic experience. This site, initiated and maintained on the basis of the Correspondances artistic and cultural education programs, is open to all groups wishing to extend their discovery of works and artists at the art center.<br><br>In redesigning its website, La Criée has chosen to emphasize the links between its programming and art mediation, giving Correspondances its rightful place on the new site (only available on the French version).</p>
