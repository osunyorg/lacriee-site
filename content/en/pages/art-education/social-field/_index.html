        <p>The art center co-constructs actions combining arts discovery, exhibition practice, and exercise of cultural rights, in a dynamic of inclusion, exchange, and sharing. Based on its artistic programming and in partnership with host structures, La Criée supports artists in their research projects or shared creation with residents. This can be in priority neighborhoods of Rennes, in penitentiary centers, or in rural areas.</p>
