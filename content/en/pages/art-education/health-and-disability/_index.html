        <p>Since 2006, La Criée has been working with people in care at hospitals, medical-social, or pedagogical centers, at the invitation of health managers, teachers, or educators, in various ways. This may include artist video projections, writing or artistic practice workshops, thematic interventions with games or artist books, offered based on the art center's exhibitions. The public services department also supports creation projects within artist residencies in hospital settings, programmed in connection with La Criée's artistic cycles and the host structure's cultural project.</p>

      notes: >-
        <p>Projects are defined one year in advance and lead to signing an agreement with the health facility, in partnership and with support from the Ministry of Health – ARS and Ministry of Culture – DRAC Bretagne, within the Culture-Health program.</p>
