        <p>On the basis of its artistic programme, La Criée works with teaching teams from schools in Rennes and the Ille-et-Vilaine département to develop projects based on the three pillars of artistic and cultural education :<br> -- Knowledge of the works and learning about art history<br> -- Encounters with the artists and their work<br>-- And artistic practice to enable students to take part in sensitive experiences and develop their expression, creativity and critical thinking.</p>

        <p><b>Artist residencies<br></b></p><p>  </p><p>Since 2008, La Criée has been working with artists in residence on projects combining research, creation and transmission. Residencies in schools combine the art center's missions of supporting artists and producing works with artistic and cultural education, enabling students to take part in an artistic creation process.<br>The residencies may involve several classes, combined with times for exhibition visits, cultural discovery and artistic practice. These projects provide an ideal framework for working on cross-curricular educational themes with teachers, parents, families and other local stakeholders.</p>

      notes: >-
        <p>Duration: the residency lasts for one school year, with a minimum of 20 to 30 hours of artistic practice per class, combined with 30 hours of research and production for the artist in residence.</p>
