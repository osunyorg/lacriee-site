    Thematic cycle - Courir les Rues, Battre la Campagne, Fendre les Flots (Running the Streets, Scouring the Fields, Breaking the Waves)
  summary: >-
    <p>In 2013, La Criée centre d'art contemporain, Rennes, launched a new movement and launched a three-year thematic cycle: "Running the Streets" (2014-2014 season), "Scouring the Fields" (2015-2015 season), "Breaking the Waves" (2016-2016 season)</p>
  body: >-
    <p>About  <br>   <br>Cycle The <br>titles of these three seasons are borrowed from Raymond Queneau*. Queneau <br>was a poet and writer, referring to him, that is to say that La Criée will be for <br>the next three years a place where art is told. Queneau <br>was mathematician: like him, La Criée will feed on other disciplines. Queneau founded the OuLiPo**: Like him, The Cree will be a <br>place of experimentation and invention. Adopting a model borrowed from the performing arts in a format that is new to the art center, La Criée collaborates with an associate artist each season. This format allows us to experiment with a new way of working with an artist over time, to be as close as possible to the creative process, to imagine new partnerships, and to develop special relationships with our audience. Cycle  Running the Streets, Scouring the Fields, Breaking the Waves  cycle is built around the geographical, social, and cultural territories in which it takes place. It explores three horizons of action and three concomitant imaginaries: urban space, rural space, and coastal space. Based on the conviction that art is a means of understanding the world and a source of enchantment,  Running the Streets, Scouring the Fields, Breaking the Waves  aim to break down barriers between categories and foster dialogue between artistic disciplines, confronting them with other fields of knowledge through exhibitions, events, encounters, productions, residencies, publications, and, we hope, the invention of new forms. So come in, walk, run: we await you, numerous and curious, diverse and demanding, to run through the streets, beat the countryside, and devour the waves with us! Because, if artists are our salt and works of art our asphalt, you are our fertile soil! And because art, like poetry, overflows everything: they are the free escape***. <br>*  Running the Streets, Scouring the Fields, Breaking the Waves </p>  <p>are the titles of collections by Raymond Queneau © Editions Gallimard. ** The Oulipo (Workshop of Potential Literature) is an international group of writers and mathematicians founded in 1960 by mathematician François Le Lionnais, with writer and poet Raymond Queneau as co-founder. The Oulipians use constraints, both existing and invented, as a source of inspiration for their writing.  *** According to Jean-Didier Vincent, neuropsychiatrist and neurobiologist</p>  <p>   <br>Courir les Rues (Running the Streets) </p>  <p>The city is the playground <br>for  Courir les Rues .  Here play means imagining, <br>experimenting, creating, transmitting.    The city of  Courir les Rues  is a space you roam, you <br>traverse, a space for hanging out, accelerating, picking stuff up.  It's a place of <br>encounters, but of conflicts too.  The city of  Courir les Rues  is a muse.  The city of  Courir les Rues  is a mirror of our <br>modern lives. </p>  <p>  <br>  <br>For a year the city will <br>be taking up residence at a La Criée transformed into a public space. With four <br>exhibitions planned: solo shows by Jan Kopp, Ziad Antar and Amalia Pica, and <br>the group show  Les Horizons . </p>  <p>  </p>  <p>All sorts of events will back <br>up the exhibitions: concerts, encounters, performances, surprise visits, etc.</p>  <p> </p>  <p> </p>  <p> And in return La Criée <br>will spend a year exploring the city: via creative projects in Rennes' <br>neighbourhoods with artists Lucas Grandin and François Feutrie, and all kinds <br>of activities in the public arena.</p>  <p> </p>  <p> Jan Kopp will be the <br>associate artist for  Courir les Rues , <br>offering an all-new exhibition and a project involving local students and <br>residents, as well as fuelling the programme with his interests, ideas and <br>explorations</p>  <p> </p>  <p> Looking further abroad - <br>to Cluj and Belgrade - in the context of the  ACT Democ[k]racy  project, La Criée will examine the issue of the <br>city as a locus for the expression or repression of democracy.</p>  <p>   </p>  <p> And to help the public <br>keep tabs on things, throughout the season La Criée will publish  Cailloux  at irregular intervals: a <br>closer look at the work being done in and outside the city, in the form of <br>articles by critics and researchers, contributions by artists, interviews and <br>more.   </p>  <p>  <br>  <br>That's how  Courir les Rues  will draw up a new urban <br>geography.  In which it will be <br>revealed that from vast slabs of <br>concrete to unpaved alleys  <br>                 </p>  <p>and from boulevards at <br>dusk  to the paths of desire, the streets are <br>proliferating.</p>  <p> Artiste associé </p>  <p>   <br>Battre la Campagne  (Beating the <br>Bushes) </p>  <p> </p>  <p>Abandoning the pavement for dirt roads, and housing estates for ants' nests, <br>the artists of our 2014-2015 season are calling on us to take a break from the din <br>of the everyday. They're inviting us to get out a little, to drop in on their yards and <br>gardens, sit down at their tables,  go on excursions with them that will get us <br>out of the rut. </p>  <p>            </p>  <p> The expression 'beating the bushes' suggests, among other things, heading <br>off in all directions, strolling casually, rambling maybe.  So this is a season for roaming, for not being <br>afraid to mistake one work for another, or an oil painting for a glass <br>sculpture; for turning daydreaming into an exact science.</p>  <p>  </p>  <p>For a year the country will be sprouting at La Criée, an art centre <br>transformed into a combination of wheatfield and active fallowland. Four <br>exhibitions in a row: solo efforts by Gareth Moore, Yves Chaudouët and <br>Jérémie Gindre, and the group show  a l l e r dehors . ( g o i n g outdoors ).  All sorts of events will be tying in with the exhibitions: concerts, encounters, <br>performances, surprise visits, etc. </p>  <p> In return La Criée will be scouring the countryside: artists Mark Brown, <br>Thomas Tudoux and Bevis Martin & Charlie Youle will be heading up local <br>creative projects in agricultural high schools and other urban and rural <br>establishments, and there will be further off-site activities as well.  </p>  <p>  <br>  <br>Yves Chaudouët is the  Battre la Campagne (Beating the <br>Bushes)  guest artist. He will be offering an exhibition spilling out beyond <br>the walls of La Criée and into the Rennes countryside; doing the scenography <br>for a second exhibition; inviting his theatre company and all sorts of other <br>fertile sources of inspiration; and in general fuelling the programme with his <br>interests, ideas and investigations. </p>  <p> Beating the bushes in their own thoughtful way, the study days he is <br>organising aim at triggering dialogue between different fields of knowledge, together <br>with meetings between artists, biologists, landscapers and philosophers as they <br>compare their different ways of reading landscape and envisioning creativity.</p>  <p> </p>  <p> To keep everyone up to date, <br>throughout the season La Criée will be publishing occasional reviews -  Les Cailloux  - that follow up what's <br>happening inside and outside the art centre with pieces by critics and <br>researchers, artistic contributions, interviews and more. A way of broadening <br>everyone's horizons. </p>  <p> </p>  <p> Beating the Bushes Is <br>drawing landscapes and faces  Is <br>turning the art centre into a living art laboratory  Is <br>beating to the rhythm of a growing leaf  Is  g o i n g <br> outdoors    <br>           </p>  <p>Is <br>getting lost   <br>                    </p>  <p>Is <br>gathering herbs   <br>                              </p>  <p>Is <br>(self) cultivation</p>  <p> Is <br>learning   <br>           </p>  <p>Is <br>discovering                    Is <br>look-seeing</p>  <p> Artiste associé </p>  <p>   <br>Fendre les Flots ( Breaking the Waves ) </p>  <p>After  Running the Streets  ( Courir les Rues  / 2013-2014 season), then  Scouring the Fields  ( Battre la Campagne  / 2014-2015 season), La Criée centre for contemporary art is  Breaking the Waves  ( Fendre les Flots  / season 2015-2016) - and inviting you to join in. <br> Ariane Michel is the associate artist of the art centre's 2015-2016 season:  Fendre les Flots  (Breaking the Waves).  In company with the artists here for the 2015-2016 season you'll be  <br>able to stroll the shoreline, wander the cliffs and saunter along the  <br>coast; then watch the artists disappear as they head out to sea and  <br>vanish over the horizon. With them you'll encounter animals, rocks and  <br>plants, tides turned back and the mighty Atlantic swell, equinoctial  <br>storms and the return of the sun, impenetrable fogs and whole new  <br>worlds. This season the sea is terra incognita, open to all our  <br>imaginings. <br> Fendre les Flots  (Breaking the Waves) is going to bring  <br>endless visual shifts: looking at people from the landscape's point of  <br>view, challenging our connection with conquest and making the language  <br>of water, plankton and trees tangible.</p>  <p>   <br>For a year La Criée will be transformed into a port,                              a boat                                              a wave                                                              a world's end.  <br>With four exhibitions in a row: solo shows by Runo Lagomarsino, Ariane Michel and Joana Escoval, and the group show  L'Épais Réel . And all sorts of Green Flashes tying in with them, including concerts, encounters and performances. <br> La Criée will be meeting the waves too: with an exhibition organised  <br>by this year's associate artist Ariane Michel, who will be bringing  <br>together twenty artists all summer at Cap Sizun, in Finistère; with a  <br>Territories in the Making project headed up by Antoine Martinet in  <br>Rennes, further afield in Brittany and across the Atlantic; and with a  <br>collaboration with European Higher School of Art of Brittany (EESAB) and <br> B.O.A.T ®, an artistic and educational research ship captained for this <br> crossing by Marcel Dinahet and Nicolas Floch'. <br> At Esquibien, on the Finistère coast, Ariane Michel's solo show will  <br>yield a film and second exhibition at La Criée. The artist will also be  <br>offering a series of screenings and more generally fuelling the  <br>programme with her interests, ideas and explorations. <br> To provide a record of all this, La Criée will once again be issuing its "aperiodicals" -  Cailloux  <br> - which follow up what's happening on- and off-site: texts by critics  <br>and researchers, contributions by artists, interviews and more -  <br>something to broaden everybody's horizons. <br> Fendre les Flots (Breaking the Waves)  means setting out in search of new worlds:  <br>making discoveries that are not conquests, but rather worlds we are  <br>sometimes so close to without knowing it. Breaking the Waves means  <br>jumping aboard  <br>"To get away, far away from fossil possibilities  <br>Far from the cubes ready to crumble into dust  <br>And to reach beyond islands beyond continents  <br>The door that opens to merry mariners."*</p>  <p>* Raymond Queneau,  Le Bout du monde , <br>from his collection of poems  Fendre les Flots , éditions Gallimard.</p>  <p> Artiste associée </p>  <p> Exhibitions  <br> Outside the walls exhibitions  <br> Residencies  <br> Research projects  <br> Education projects  <br> Editions and artist's multiple  <br> Produced works  </p>

A way of broadening everyone's horizons.      </p><p><i>Beating the Bushes<br></i>Is drawing landscapes and faces <br>Is turning the art centre into a living art laboratory <br>Is beating to the rhythm of a growing leaf <br>Is <i>g o i n g </i><i>outdoors</i> <br>              Is getting lost <br>                       Is gathering herbs <br>                                 Is (self) cultivation  </p><p>Is learning <br>              Is discovering<br>                   Is look-seeing        </p>

        <p><b><i>Fendre les Flots (</i></b><em>Breaking the Waves</em>)</p><p>  After <em>Running the Streets</em> (<i>Courir les Rues</i> / 2013-2014 season), then <em>Scouring the Fields</em> (<i>Battre la Campagne</i> / 2014-2015 season), La Criée centre for contemporary art is <em>Breaking the Waves</em> (<i>Fendre les Flots</i> / season 2015-2016) - and inviting you to join in. </p><p>Ariane Michel is the associate artist of the art centre's 2015-2016 season: <i>Fendre les Flots</i> (Breaking the Waves). <br>In company with the artists here for the 2015-2016 season you'll be  able to stroll the shoreline, wander the cliffs and saunter along the  coast; then watch the artists disappear as they head out to sea and  vanish over the horizon. With them you'll encounter animals, rocks and  plants, tides turned back and the mighty Atlantic swell, equinoctial  storms and the return of the sun, impenetrable fogs and whole new  worlds. This season the sea is terra incognita, open to all our  imaginings. </p><p><i>Fendre les Flots</i> (Breaking the Waves) is going to bring  endless visual shifts: looking at people from the landscape's point of  view, challenging our connection with conquest and making the language  of water, plankton and trees tangible.  </p>

        <p> For a year La Criée will be transformed into a port,<br>                             a boat<br>                                             a wave<br>                                                             a world's end.<br><br> With four exhibitions in a row: solo shows by Runo Lagomarsino, Ariane Michel and Joana Escoval, and the group show <i>L'Épais Réel</i>. And all sorts of Green Flashes tying in with them, including concerts, encounters and performances. </p><p>La Criée will be meeting the waves too: with an exhibition organised  by this year's associate artist Ariane Michel, who will be bringing  together twenty artists all summer at Cap Sizun, in Finistère; with a  Territories in the Making project headed up by Antoine Martinet in  Rennes, further afield in Brittany and across the Atlantic; and with a  collaboration with European Higher School of Art of Brittany (EESAB) and  B.O.A.T ®, an artistic and educational research ship captained for this  crossing by Marcel Dinahet and Nicolas Floch'. </p><p>At Esquibien, on the Finistère coast, Ariane Michel's solo show will  yield a film and second exhibition at La Criée. The artist will also be  offering a series of screenings and more generally fuelling the  programme with her interests, ideas and explorations. </p><p>To provide a record of all this, La Criée will once again be issuing its "aperiodicals" - <i>Cailloux</i>  - which follow up what's happening on- and off-site: texts by critics  and researchers, contributions by artists, interviews and more -  something to broaden everybody's horizons. </p><p><i>Fendre les Flots (Breaking the Waves)</i> means setting out in search of new worlds:  making discoveries that are not conquests, but rather worlds we are  sometimes so close to without knowing it. Breaking the Waves means  jumping aboard<br> "To get away, far away from fossil possibilities<br> Far from the cubes ready to crumble into dust<br> And to reach beyond islands beyond continents<br> The door that opens to merry mariners."*  </p>
