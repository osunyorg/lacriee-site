    Thematic cycle - Alors que j’écoutais moi aussi […] Félicia Atkinson, Julien Bismuth et Yann Sérandour jan. 2017 – feb. 2018
  summary: >-
    <p> While I was also listening to Felicia Atkinson, Julien Bismuth and Yann  Sérandour telling stories about artworks and exhibitions, I wanted to  invite them to come and share at La Criée.  </p>
  body: >-
    <p>About  <br>   <br>			 Yann's a long-time Rennes resident, Felicia moved here a year ago, and Julien lives in New York. All three of them travel a lot. Julien and Yann were born in the 1970s and Felicia a little later. We started out by discussing narrative, orality, rumour, multiple  <br>points of view, exhibitions we hadn't seen but had been told about. One  <br>of us mentioned Paul Ricoeur and his open-ended definition of narrative, <br> which ties it not to a fixed form but to a relationship with time. Felicia, Julien and Yann enjoy being told stories and enjoy telling them.  <br> Somebody else found the title of the series. It comes from the American poet and performer David Antin, from one of his  talk poems  and their blend of improvisation and narrative, anecdote and philosophy, poetry and action. <br> Felicia, Julien and Yann are inventors, activators and remixers of stories.  <br> So we opted for constructing a subjective, polyphonic narrative, one  <br>addressing the question of our relationship with books, statements and  <br>enunciation. We wanted to write a shared story, invented by some people  <br>then told by others, listened to by others still and then transformed by <br> some of them. We wanted to develop narratives of real or imaginary  <br>exhibitions, using deliberately multiple, experimental temporal and  <br>spatial frameworks, ranging from publications to concerts and  <br>performances, fables and essays. <br> Felicia, Julien and Yann like to invite other artists to work with them.  <br> And then we simply decided that each of us would have a solo show and <br> that there would also be two group shows to bookend the series. The  <br>list of artists for these exhibitions is still a secret, but among  <br>others we were thinking of David and Eleanor Antin, Mark Geffriaud,  <br>Mariana Castillo Deball, Simon Starling and Zin Taylor. <br> Felicia, Julien and Yann are going to set up an office at La Criée as their workshop within the exhibitions. In addition to the exhibitions we'll invite other storytellers  <br>for concerts, talks, discussions and off-site projects. We've already  <br>asked, Élise Ladoué, Stephane Ginsburgh, Camille Bondon and  <br>Clémence Estève. And we'll be celebrating a birthday: the Centre Pompidou is turning  <br>forty, and we'll be running experiments in the Kandinsky Library there.  <br>Things will wind up with a book telling this story and building up on  <br>it.</p>  <p>  <br>		</p>  <p> Associated artist  <br> Exhibitions  <br> Residencies  <br> Research projects  <br> Éditions  <br>  Editions and artist's multiple  <br>  Produced works  </p>
