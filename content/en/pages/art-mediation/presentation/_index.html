        <p>Art mediation is developed in two ways :<br><b>-- Around the exhibitions </b>: with a program of encounters for the general public, tours and workshops tailored to groups, and artistic and cultural education courses.<br><br><b>-- Outside the walls</b> : with research, creation and transmission residencies in Rennes, the département and the rest of Brittany. <br>All art mediation initiatives are designed and carried out in partnership with a network of professionals in the fields of education, pedagogy, higher education, social work, health, disability and integration.<br>For all our audiences, our actions focus on discovery, experimentation and cooperation, as close as possible to artistic creation.<br>Art mediation is also conceived as a laboratory space, with the creation of tools designed with artists, graphic artists and designers around our artistic programming: artists' games, editions created for and with young audiences or podcasts.<br>Driven by unique artistic projects, La Criée develops a dynamic of transmission in a spirit of sharing and exchange, at the art center, in the territories and in the digital space on our website.<br></p>
